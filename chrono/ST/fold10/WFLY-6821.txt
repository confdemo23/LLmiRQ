Not possible to overlay non existing file in WAR - mark the sub deployment which will be mounted exploded
It is either bug in how deployments are treated or how overlay/vfs work.
Steps to reproduce:
1. deploy undexploded war with jar inside
2. add overlay that will add non existing file in jar
Result: exception:
Caused by: org.jboss.as.server.deployment.DeploymentUnitProcessingException: JBAS018776: Failed to get content for deployment overlay WEB-INF/lib/overlayed.jar//META-INF/x/file.txt at WEB-INF/lib/overlayed.jar//META-INF/x/file.txt
    Caused by: java.io.FileNotFoundException: /content/shell.war/WEB-INF/lib/overlayed.jar/META-INF/x/file.txt"}}

Expectation:
 should work. It actually does work, if war is really exploded or
&amp;apos;if(exploded)&amp;apos; part in overlay is removed from overlay processor and everything is handled via: https://github.com/stuartwdouglas/wildfly-core/blob/a75af9118c4062fafb899b2c1109387a0748d925/server/src/main/java/org/jboss/as/server/deployment/DeploymentOverlayDeploymentUnitProcessor.java#L117
This is part of the fix of above issue, which depends on WFCORE-761.
