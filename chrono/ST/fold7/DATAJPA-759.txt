Log names of Class and Mapping Files found during scan to DEBUG level in ClasspathScanningPersistenceUnitPostProcessor
This is very minor low-hanging fruit. 
When users troubleshoot Entity Manager classpath scanning, it is helpful to enable DEBUG logging to see what Entity/MappedSuperclass and Mapping Files are found by spring. In fact, this logging was the intention of the current code, however it fails to output the actual resource name that was found, as below:






07/10/2015 11:17:43 DEBUG org.springframework.data.jpa.support.ClasspathScanningPersistenceUnitPostProcessor (ClasspathScanningPersistenceUnitPostProcessor.java:101) - Registering classpath-scanned entity %s in persistence unit info!




07/10/2015 11:17:43 DEBUG org.springframework.data.jpa.support.ClasspathScanningPersistenceUnitPostProcessor (ClasspathScanningPersistenceUnitPostProcessor.java:106) - Registering classpath-scanned entity mapping file in persistence unit info!






Since slf4j is being used, the fix is likely just adding the "{}" token instead of "%s".






in: org.springframework.data.jpa.support.ClasspathScanningPersistenceUnitPostProcessor.postProcessPersistenceUnitInfo(MutablePersistenceUnitInfo)




. . .




LOG.debug("Registering classpath-scanned entity %s in persistence unit info!", definition.getBeanClassName());




. . .




LOG.debug("Registering classpath-scanned entity mapping file in persistence unit info!", location);
