QueryMapper prevents searching for values that start with a $ [dollarsign]
When querying for values that start with a dollar sign the QueryMapper.Keyword#isKeyword recognizes this as a keyword, resulting in a ClassCastException (QueryMapper.java:311)
The following snippet demonstrates this behaviour:






mongoTemplate.find(query(where("myvalue").is("$334")), My.class);






The mongo keywords (&amp;apos;$gt&amp;apos; etc.) would usually be provided with the associated methods (.gt() etc.). A is() query should either not try to recognize keywords or at least be more specific (not only check for a leading &amp;apos;$&amp;apos;).
How could a query for a value that starts with a dollar sign be written otherwise, using the Spring MongoTemplate?
