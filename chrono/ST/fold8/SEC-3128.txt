RoleVoter throws NPE with null Authentication
Using AccessDecisionManager manually(just like how webflow integrates with security) is causing NPE if no `Authentication` is present:






Authentication authentication = SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication();




manager.decide(authentication, object, configAttributes);












java.lang.NullPointerException




	at org.springframework.security.access.vote.RoleVoter.extractAuthorities(RoleVoter.java:119)




	at org.springframework.security.access.vote.RoleVoter.vote(RoleVoter.java:99)




	at org.springframework.security.access.vote.AffirmativeBased.decide(AffirmativeBased.java:62)






While I could handle null `Authentication` in my class calling `accessDecisionManager` it&amp;apos;s a bit wrong that security core is throwing NPE. I didn&amp;apos;t test if `RoleVoter` is only voter throwing NPE. Not sure if you&amp;apos;d ever see this in a real web app but I wanted to add a test and see how my stuff behaves when there is no existing authentication in a sec context.
Maybe voter should actually throw a proper exception or vote `ACCESS_DENIED` or `ACCESS_ABSTAIN`. I could throw `AccessDeniedException` from my class but, imho throwing that specific exception is security&amp;apos;s job.
