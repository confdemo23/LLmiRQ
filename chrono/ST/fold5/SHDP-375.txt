RollingFileNamingStrategy gets into trouble with certain filenames
RollingFileNamingStrategy is using a wrong parsing method trying to find a `rolling` part of a file name to initialize its own counter from where to continue. Problem is simply because code is trying to parse integers from a file name and if it contains numeric part which cannot be parsed, exception is thrown which is not catched.






Caused by: java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "571195529825"




at java.lang.NumberFormatException.forInputString(NumberFormatException.java:65)






We just need to make sure that we don&amp;apos;t fail by trying to find the rolling part which should be a last number in a file name.
