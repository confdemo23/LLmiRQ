Generated JAX-RS application should not take precedence
I have a WAR which contains a bunch of JSF views and two JAX-RS applications, each with its own @ApplicationPath on a class extending javax.ws.rs.core.Application.
When starting the Swarm JAR, I see this line in the log:






2016-03-27 21:21:33,457 INFO  [org.jboss.resteasy.resteasy_jaxrs.i18n] (ServerService Thread Pool -- 15) RESTEASY002225: Deploying javax.ws.rs.core.Application: class org.wildfly.swarm.generated.WildFlySwarmDefaultJAXRSApplication






and it seems that all my JSF URLs are handled by RESTEasy:






2016-03-27 21:21:48,757 ERROR [io.undertow.request] (default task-1) UT005023: Exception handling request to /myapp/login.xhtml: javax.ws.rs.NotFoundException: RESTEASY003210: Could not find resource for full path: http://localhost:8080/myapp/login.xhtml




        at org.jboss.resteasy.core.registry.SegmentNode.match(SegmentNode.java:114)




        at org.jboss.resteasy.core.registry.RootNode.match(RootNode.java:43)






I don&amp;apos;t think there is a need for a generated JAX-RS application in this setup, and it definitely shouldn&amp;apos;t catch all URLs.
