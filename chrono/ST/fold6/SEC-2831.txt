RegexRequestMatcher/AntPathRequestMatcher should not throw exception with invalid HTTP method in the request
Observed behavior
Unknown HTTP method will cause IllegalArgumentException in LogoutFilter &gt; AntPathRequestMatcher. Stack trace:






java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No enum constant org.springframework.http.HttpMethod.PROPFIND




	at java.lang.Enum.valueOf(Enum.java:236)




	at org.springframework.http.HttpMethod.valueOf(HttpMethod.java:27)




	at org.springframework.security.web.util.matcher.AntPathRequestMatcher.matches(AntPathRequestMatcher.java:125)




	at org.springframework.security.web.authentication.logout.LogoutFilter.requiresLogout(LogoutFilter.java:122)




	at org.springframework.security.web.authentication.logout.LogoutFilter.doFilter(LogoutFilter.java:94)




...






This issue is more severe as this will fail on any request with unknown HTTP method (i.e. not just request to logout filter processing URI).
Note that this is not a feature request to support custom HTTP methods, but really a bug report about incorrect handling of unknown HTTP method.
Expected behavior
Request with unknown HTTP method MUST NOT end with internal server error. Such request should just not be matched if a required HTTP method is specified.
How to reproduce
Use any web application with LogoutFilter processing configured:






curl -XANY_METHOD http://host:port/context/any-path
