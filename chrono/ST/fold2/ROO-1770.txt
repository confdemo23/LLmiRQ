ConcurrentModificationException in project creation with IBM JDK
I am trying to create a new Spring Roo Project using STS by invoking File-&gt;New-&gt;Spring Roo Project. The wizard fails and closes so I cannot see the error. The created project does not have any source folders (and applicationContext.xml as a result) or a pom.xml file. Bu the Roo Shell is accessible in STS. Invoking "project --topLevelPackage com.test" reveals the error as this:
ConcurrentModificationException at java.util.HashMap$AbstractMapIterator.checkConcurrentMod(HashMap.java:122)
which is followed by this error:
NullPointerException at org.springframework.roo.classpath.itd.AbstractItdMetadataProvider.notify(AbstractItdMetadataProvider.java:78)
The log.roo file does not contain much but it is attached anyway. If I use Sun JDK (1.6.0.22) the wizard works well and Roo creates the project as intended.
