Bindy CSV separator not treated as regex but fixed character in all cases
In the camel-bindy documentation (http://camel.apache.org/bindy.html) it says that the @CsvRecord separator parameter is interpreted as a regex. While that does seem to be the case when the record is being parsed, it seems to be treated as a literal string when autospanLine is true.
For example, if we have 



@CsvRecord(separator="\\s+", autospanLine=true)



 and we have defined three string @DataField fields, and we have a line of input like this:



     field1 field2 field3a field3b



then the third field value will be



    "field3a\s+field3b"



Looking at the code in BindyCsvDataFormat.java it seems that this is because in some cases the separator string is treated as a literal string, not a regex. For example, this also seems to be true in some cases in the unquoteTokens method.
