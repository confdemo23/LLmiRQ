Failing RemoteFailoverTestCase#testStatefulFailover when transaction run under JTS
I can see failing test RemoteFailoverTestCase#testStatefulFailover when transactions are set to run under JTS. I&amp;apos;m not sure if this is a trouble of clustering component or only a testsuite issue.
This could be connected with JBEAP-1954.
