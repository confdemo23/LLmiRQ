Cannot clone or ad-hoc describe legacy extensions
Trying to clone a profile that includes legacy extensions results in this failure (which is buried and not properly reported, but that&amp;apos;s a different problem):
WFLYCTL0309: Legacy extension &amp;apos;org.jboss.as.web&amp;apos; is not supported on servers running this version. The extension is only supported for use by hosts running a previous release in a mixed-version managed domain
It&amp;apos;s created by UnsupportedSubsystemDescribeHandler.
That failure made some sense when the only use of the &amp;apos;describe&amp;apos; op was by an HC launching a domain server, but now &amp;apos;describe&amp;apos; is also an impl detail of the &amp;apos;clone&amp;apos; op, and describe may also be executed independently by users.
We need to distinguish the server launch case from other uses and only fail in the former.
