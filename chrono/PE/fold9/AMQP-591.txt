CachingConnectionFactory leaks channels when using channelCacheSize & channelCheckoutTimeout settings
The channelCacheSize &amp; channelCheckoutTimeout settings can be used to constrain the number of available RabbitMQ channels per connection. If a connection is lost for some reason (network glitch, rabbit restarted etc), the CachingConnectionFactory starts leaking channels, and eventually fails with "no available channels".
