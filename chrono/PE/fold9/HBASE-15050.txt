Block Ref counting does not work in Region Split cases.
The reference counting on the blocks does not work correctly when the HalfStorefileReader is used for compaction/scans. 
The reason is that getFirstKey and getLastKey API create a new scanner but does not do the needed close() call and because of that we do not decrement the count on the blocks. The same impact will also be observed on the ref count that we maintain on the reader. Issue found when I was trying to test some other feature with lot of evictions.
