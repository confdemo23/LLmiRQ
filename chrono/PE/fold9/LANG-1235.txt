Add decrementAndGet/incrementAndGet to MutableInt class
Frequently when incrementing or decrementing a number, one needs to compare it to a limit. For example in loops.
At present that requires two calls:
MutableInt.decrement()
MutableInt.getValue()
It would be convenient to have a method that combined the two.
c.f. AtomicInteger.decrementAndGet()
There is less likelihood of needing these methods for other Mutable Number types as they are not often used in loops.
