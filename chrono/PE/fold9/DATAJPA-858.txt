Contains binding inspects first property for collections, not the leaf property






class User {




  Set&lt;Role&gt; roles;




}









class Role {




  String name;




}






A query findByRolesNameContaining() will fail as it tries to trigger collection contains binding as it&amp;apos;s inspecting the first traversal (the one to roles). It has to inspect the leaf property instead and only trigger that special binding if the leaf property is a collection.
