CsvFormat.nullString should not be escaped
Hello,
Use case: I&amp;apos;m generating MySQL dump files (text format) - for more details check this - http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/select-into.html. 
Issue: The value null is represented as "\N". Also by default the escape char is &amp;apos;\N&amp;apos;. The CsvPrinter.printAndEscape method will convert this value into 

"\\N"

I suggest to modify the CsvPrinter in order to not escape the nullString value  - it should be written as it is. I can create a pull request if you want.
I consider it a minor issue because it can be mitigated by making sure that the escape character is not a part of the nullString - however in my case it means that the LOAD commands should be modified accordingly.
