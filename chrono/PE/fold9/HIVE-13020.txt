Hive Metastore and HiveServer2 to Zookeeper fails with IBM JDK
HiveServer2 and Hive Metastore Zookeeper component is hardcoded to only support the Oracle/Open JDK. I was performing testing of Hadoop running on the IBM JDK and discovered this issue and have since drawn up the attached patch. This looks to resolve the issue in a similar manner as how the Hadoop core folks handle the IBM JDK.
