Custom RememberMeServices that does not implement LogoutHandler fails
the issue
When your RememberMe service does not implement LogoutHandler the RememberMeConfigurer sets a null logout handler RememberMeConfigurer:287 and the LogoutFilter accepts it just fine LogoutConfigurer:87 later causing an NPE when executing the handlers LogoutFilter:111. This is definitely not expected behaviour.
Steps to reproduce:
1) Create a spring boot app
2) Create a class that implements RememberMeServices but not LogoutHandler
3) Configure HttpSecurity to use it:






protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {




http()




				.rememberMe()




				.rememberMeServices(rememberMeServices()) 






4) Try to login then logout of your app. 
Proposed solution
LogoutConfigurer should never accept null handlers. A null check in the addLogoutHandler method should be sufficient. Also make RememberMeServices extend LogoutHandler so that users are aware of the dependency later on.






public LogoutConfigurer&lt;H&gt; addLogoutHandler(LogoutHandler logoutHandler) {




                Assert.notNull(logoutHandler, "logoutHandler cannot be null");




		this.logoutHandlers.add(logoutHandler);




		return this;




}
