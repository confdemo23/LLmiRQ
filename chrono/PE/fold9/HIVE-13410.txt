PerfLog metrics scopes not closed if there are exceptions on HS2
If there are errors, the HS2 PerfLog api scopes are not closed.  Then there are sometimes messages like &amp;apos;java.io.IOException: Scope named api_parse is not closed, cannot be opened.&amp;apos;
I had simply forgetting to close the dangling scopes if there is an exception.  Doing so now.
