CompositeTransformer does not transform addresses
If /some=where has a child redirection for the child=* child resource to new-child=*, then






{




    "operation" =&gt; "add",




    "address" =&gt; [




        ("some" =&gt; "where"),




        ("child" =&gt; "*")




    ]




}






gets correctly transformed to 






{




    "operation" =&gt; "add",




    "address" =&gt; [




        ("some" =&gt; "where"),




        ("new-child" =&gt; "*")




    ]




}






But if wrapped in a composite, e.g.:






{




    "operation" =&gt; "composite",




    "address" =&gt; [],




    "steps" =&gt; [




        {




            "operation" =&gt; "add",




            "address" =&gt; [




                ("some" =&gt; "where"),




                ("child" =&gt; "*")




            ]




        }




    ]




}






the redirection does not happen in the transformed composite, so we have the original






{




    "operation" =&gt; "composite",




    "address" =&gt; [],




    "steps" =&gt; [




        {




            "operation" =&gt; "add",




            "address" =&gt; [




                ("some" =&gt; "where"),




                ("child" =&gt; "*")




            ]




        }




    ]




}






rather than the expected






{




    "operation" =&gt; "composite",




    "address" =&gt; [],




    "steps" =&gt; [




        {




            "operation" =&gt; "add",




            "address" =&gt; [




                ("some" =&gt; "where"),




                ("new-child" =&gt; "*")




            ]




        }




    ]




}
