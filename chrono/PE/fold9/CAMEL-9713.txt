Can not set custom Jetty HttpClient to producer endpoint
The camel-jetty page has a "httpClient" option that can be set on camel-jetty producer endpoint and it says:



To use a shared org.eclipse.jetty.client.HttpClient for all producers created by this endpoint. This option should only be used in special circumstances.

This option should only be used in special circumstances.



In some cases, user might want to set a shard Jetty HttpClient among camel-jetty producer endpoints. For instance, user might use recipientList with camel-jetty producer endpoint to support multiple dynamically created URLs. So setting a shared Jetty HttpClient with a shared thread pool would be ideal to avoid exploding number of producer endpoints + their own producer thread pools in this use case. However, there is no way to set it to camel-jetty producer endpoint.
