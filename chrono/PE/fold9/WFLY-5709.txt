Fix messaging HA colocated  configuration
The HA configuration for the messaging-activemq&amp;apos;s server resource has issues to fix:

the shared-store-colocated configuration creates replication live/backup configuration instead of shared-store ones.
the tailback-delay attribute is deprecated and should be replaced by an attribute backed by initialReplicationSyncTimeout property
live and backup configuration must always be created for colocated configurations.
