CLI class is mixing commands and operations
CLI.cmd method logic is not in sync with the CLI syntax. 
A fallback is implemented in order to route requests to cx.handle only if ctx.buildRequest(cliCommand) is failing. 
For example this doesn&amp;apos;t cope with reload vs :reload. In this case, buildRequest will succeed both for reload and :reload. CLI.cmd("reload") will end to be treated as CLI.cmd(":reload");
Furthermore batch and workflow are not supported by CLI.
I am suggesting to implement the following logic:
1) If batch is enabled or a workflow is enabled, route the command to handle
2) Parse the request.
3) If this is an operation, route to execute
4) Otherwise route to handle
