ResultProcessor should use ConversionService as fallback if target is a class
If the actual conversion target in repository projections is not an interface, ResultProcessor currently fails with the ProjectionFactory rejecting the type. We could rather use a standard ConversionService implementation so that normal object conversion mechanisms can kick in (i.e. the ObjectToObjectConverter supporting converting factory methods, and constructors).
