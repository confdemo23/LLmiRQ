Parsing PAX headers fails with NegativeArraySizeException
The TarArchiveInputStream.parsePaxHeaders method fails with a NegativeArraySizeException when there is an empty line at the end of the headers.
The inner loop starts reading the length, but it gets a newline (10) and ends up subtracting &amp;apos;0&amp;apos; (48) from it; the result is a negative length that blows up an attempt to allocate the rest array.
I would say that a check to see if ch is less the &amp;apos;0&amp;apos; and break the loop if it is.
I used npm pack aws-sdk@2.2.16 to generate a tarball with this issue.
