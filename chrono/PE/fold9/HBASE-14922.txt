Delayed flush doesn&apos;t work causing flush storms.
Starting all regionservers at the same time will mean that most PeriodicMemstoreFlusher&amp;apos;s will be running at the same time. So all of these threads will queue flushes at about the same time.
This was supposed to be mitigated by Delayed. However that isn&amp;apos;t nearly enough. This results in the immediate filling up and then draining of the flush queues every hour.
