CalendarBasedTimeout needs to trim whitespaces in ScheduleExpression.timezone
When creating a calendar-based timer with a timezone id having leading/trailiing whitespaces, the specified timezone is ignored and the system default timezone is used instead.
Although there is a warning, users may not notice it and would still expect the requested timezone to be used.
The logged warning:






13:18:14,259 WARN  [org.jboss.as.ejb3] (default task-42) WFLYEJB0015: Unknown timezone id:




                                            US/Eastern




                                         found in schedule expression. Ignoring it and using server&amp;apos;s timezone: America/New_York






The user-provided timezone &amp;apos;US/Eastern&amp;apos; is a valid timezone (after trimming).
