CellCounter improvements
Looking at the CellCounter map reduce, it seems like it can be improved in a few areas:

it does not currently support setting scan batching.  This is important when we&amp;apos;re fetching all versions for columns.  Actually, it would be nice to support all of the scan configuration currently provided in TableInputFormat.
generating job counters containing row keys and column qualifiers is guaranteed to blow up on anything but the smallest table.  This is not usable and doesn&amp;apos;t make any sense when the same counts are in the job output.  The row and qualifier specific counters should be dropped.
