Cluster mget not working
With a 3-node redis cluster, all masters, I&amp;apos;ve set 100 keys via mset, which seems to have worked correctly. Note: all keys do not slot to the same cluster member. Calling JedisClusterConnection.mGet with all 100 keys returns 3 results. It&amp;apos;s hard to tell from debugging but I think the problem is in ClusterCommandExecutor.executeMuliKeyCommand, where a Map of RedisClusterNode to Future&lt;T&gt; is collected and processed. I believe it&amp;apos;s discarding the multiple futures per host here by putting them in a Map with the same key, so that the only result we end up with is the last for each cluster member.
