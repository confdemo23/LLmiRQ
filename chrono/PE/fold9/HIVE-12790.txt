Metastore connection leaks in HiveServer2
HiveServer2 keeps opening new connections to HMS each time it launches a task. These connections do not appear to be closed when the task completes thus causing a HMS connection leak. "lsof" for the HS2 process shows connections to port 9083.

The TaskRunner thread starts a new SessionState each time, which creates a new connection to the HMS (via Hive.get(conf).getMSC()) that is never closed.
Even SessionState.close(), currently not being called by the TaskRunner thread, does not close this connection.
Attaching a anonymized log snippet where the number of HMS connections reaches north of 25000+ connections.
