Fix the NPE in the MappingPdxSerializer
When an Exception occurs in the Spring Data GemFire MappingPdxSerializer.fromData(..) method during normal processing and conversion from PDX back to the application domain object type, it is possible that the value may never have been initialized, thus causing a NullPointerException in the Exception handler, which then causes the original Exception to be eaten!
