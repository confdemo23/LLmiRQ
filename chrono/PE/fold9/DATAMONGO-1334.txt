MapResultOptions limit not implemented
As I can see in the code and with the behavior I&amp;apos;m currently experiencing, it seems that limit on MapReduceOptions is not working.
In the source code, there&amp;apos;s no attribute set with the provided param, the limit(int limit) method only return the current instance.






public MapReduceOptions limit(int limit) {




    return this;




}
