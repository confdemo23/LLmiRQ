Create HiveRelFactories
Calcite 1.5.0 introduced the use of RelFactories to create the operators. In particular, RelFactories contains the factories for all the operators in the system. Although we can still implement old rules by providing each individual factory (the constructor is deprecated, but it won&amp;apos;t be removed till Calcite 2.0.0 is out), new rules will only provide constructors based on RelFactories. Thus, we propose to migrate immediately to the new interface.
