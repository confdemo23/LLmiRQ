NPE in principal-to-group group searching
In case when ldap authorization with principal-to-group group searching is used in security realm and LDAP entry found by value of &amp;apos;group-attribute&amp;apos; does not include attribute mentioned in &amp;apos;group-name-attribute&amp;apos; then it causes authentication fail. It is caused by missing null check for groupNameAttr and hidden NPE thrown from [1].
