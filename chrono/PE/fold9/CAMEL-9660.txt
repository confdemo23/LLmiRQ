HTTP producers crash when Exchange.HTTP_URI header contains unencoded unsafe characters
For instance,



template.sendBodyAndHeader("jetty:http://localhost:9000/test?bridgeEndpoint=true", "Hello World", Exchange.HTTP_URI, "/&lt;&gt;{}");



this test code crashes with the following error:



java.net.URISyntaxException: Illegal character in path at index 1: /&lt;&gt;{}



It is because there are places in the HTTP producers code where they are trying to create a java.net.URI instance based on the unsafe string "/&lt;&gt;{}".
This issue causes practical problems when bridging between Netty HTTP consumer endpoints and those HTTP producer endpoints, since Netty consumers route IN messages with Exchange.HTTP_URI header being unencoded.
