DomainClassConverter throws erroneous exception in matches
DomainClassConverter#matches throws a ConversionMatchAbbreviationException instead of correctly returning false in at least the following scenario:

sourceType is not related to targetType
targetType has a Spring Data repository with a String ID

The matches method performs the following logic:

sourceType is not assignable to targetType
targetType has a repository
the ID type is String
sourceType is not a String, and I can&amp;apos;t convert sourceType to a String

The correct response is therefore simply not to match (and in my case, to let SpEL attempt to bind to a different method overload). The converter instead throws an exception.
