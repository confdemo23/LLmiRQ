Cost to choose side table in MapJoin conversion based on cumulative cardinality
HIVE-11954 changed the logic to choose the side table in the MapJoin conversion algorithm. Initial heuristic for the cost was based on number of heavyweight operators.
This extends that work so the heuristic is based on accumulate cardinality. In the future, we should choose the side based on total latency for the input.
