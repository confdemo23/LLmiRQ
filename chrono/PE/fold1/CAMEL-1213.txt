camel-jms consumer does not set camel message id based on JMS message id if the next node is not JMS based
The code in org.apache.camel.component.jms.copyFrom looks odd
I think the ! should be removed
BEFORE

        if (!copyMessageId) {
            setMessageId(that.getMessageId());
        }


AFTER

        if (copyMessageId) {
            setMessageId(that.getMessageId());
        }


I will add a unit test (JmsToFileMessageIdTest) based on end user having some trouble with it
