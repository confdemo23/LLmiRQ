PagedResultsRequestControl failing when used with AD
Bug raised in response to following post on the spring ldap forum http://forum.springframework.org/showthread.php?t=32330
In an AD environment when using the Paged Results functionality after successfully retrieving and iterating over the returned results upto the set paged results size, the last call to results.hasMore() throws a PartialResultsException with a message of "Unprocessesed continuation reference"
This then causes the processor.postProcess(ctx) call to be missed meaning a cookie is never set to anything apart from null, meaning no more results can be returned. (this is all within the ldaptemplate::search(SearchExecutor se, NameClassPairCallbackHandler handler,DirContextProcessor processor) function)
Reply to original post on the forums indicates this is an issue with the way the exception handling works for that exception.
Same result is seen in both 1.1.1 and 1.1.2
