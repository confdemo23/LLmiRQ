Session binding conversation containers cannot be used in a cluster
See http://forum.springframework.org/showthread.php?t=41950
Original issue report:

Prior to version 1.0.4 I was able to have the functionality where if i had to restart tomcat for any reason users would be able to pick up right where they left off in a flow when tomcat came back up. This was because I am persisting my httpsessions on restart.  Since I have upgraded to SWF 1.0.4 When i restart tomcat my session are persisted as normal however I get a NoSuchConversationException.
Could this be the reason:
New in 1.0.4 you now use the session key "webflow.conversation.container." + new RandomGuid().toString(); to store the conversationContainer in the httpsession
However when tomcat restarts and we try to resume our webflow, since that RandomGuid() has now generated a different key it can no longer reference the ConversationContainer in the session since it used the old random key that was generated before tomcat restarted.
So my conversationcontainer is still in the session, but the sessionBindingConversationManager has no way to find it since the random key assigned as they session key has now changed.
Can anyone shine some light on this?

This was introduced in 1.0.4.  We should allow the key of a conversation container to be specified manually to allow unique containers per session without this random guid problem.
