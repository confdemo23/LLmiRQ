ACLs: No way to insert an ACE at the first position in the ACE list
The new Acl interface specifies the method:
void insertAce(Serializable afterAceId, Permission permission, Sid sid, boolean granting)
        throws NotFoundException;
but doesn&amp;apos;t specify what happens if the afterAceId is null. In fact the AclImpl adds it to the end of the list. This means there are two ways to add to the end of the list and no way to add to the start of the list. Either the null behaviour should be changed to add to the start of the list , or beforeAceIds should be used. Changing the behaviour of null seems preferable and requires only the one line change in the insertAce method of AclImpl:
this.aces.add(ace)
to
this.aces.add(0, ace);
This is vital functionality as we are intending to use the ordering to implement the order of precedence in an acl ie user denies, user grants, role denies, role grants then check parent.
