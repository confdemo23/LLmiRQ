Transport streams not closed in WebServiceConnection
 Currently, in the AbstractWebServiceConnection and subclasses, the TransportOutputStream and TransportInputStream are not closed, mainly because Axis1 SAAJ and Axiom lazy-load messages. 
This is not a major issue for most transports, because the streams are closed in the end (during connection.close()), but closing the streams explicitly can&amp;apos;t hurt.
