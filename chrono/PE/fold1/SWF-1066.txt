ManySelectionTrackingListDataModel and OneSelectionTrackingListDataModel don&apos;t track selections correctly when using a <rich:dataScroller> component
Using an eagerly loaded DataModel (i.e., loading an entire list of results into memory at once and then scrolling through that list via subsequent requests) uncovers a bug in the setCurrentRowSelected implementations in ManySelectionTrackingListDataModel and OneSelectionTrackingListDataModel where the selections potentially get "lost" across requests.
