DefaultDirContextValidator uses ONELEVEL_SCOPE, validateDirContext() fails
I found a small issue with org.springframework.ldap.pool.validation.DefaultDirContextValidator that will result in validateDirContext() failing for many/most LDAP implementations. The cause is that the root context search is being attempted with a search scope of SearchControls.ONELEVEL_SCOPE, the default scope when the scope isn&amp;apos;t specified. This may succeed for some LDAP implementations (I think it should for Domino), but will fail for e.g., Active Directory and SunONE.
The fix is to add
    this.searchControls.setSearchScope(SearchControls.OBJECT_SCOPE);
to the constructor.
A workaround is to subclass DefaultDirContextValidator and make the same fix.
