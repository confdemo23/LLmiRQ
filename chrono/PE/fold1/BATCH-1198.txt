processSkipCount and filterCount mixed up
There is another issue around process phase. Skips are sometimes counted as filtered items. And there is also pretty strange filter count behaviour: i&amp;apos;ve got a file with 10 items. All get processed,  everything is ok. If I fiddle with one of the records so that processor throws exception. I get 9 written, 1 skipped and 1 filtered. When there are two invalid items, i get 8 written, 2 skipped and 1 filtered too... sometimes filter counter shows more filtered items ... by counter i mean the one in StepExecution instance that is passed to afterStep() method. I believe my skippable/fatal/retriable exceptions are configured correctly (see BATCH-1159).
