INIConfiguration Does not support multi value keys
The INIConfiguration save(Writer writer) uses PrintWriter instead of using a class like PropertiesConfiguration.PropertiesWriter.
Because of that the method uses getString(String key) to get the keys value (which return onlt the first element of the list) and in doing so there is no support for multi value keys.
