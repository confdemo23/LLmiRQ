DistinguishedName violates the equals()/hashCode() contract
The javadoc for Object#hashCode states that If two objects are equal according to the equals(Object) method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result.
o.s.l.c.DistinguishedName violates this contract as shown by this sample code:

DistinguishedName dn1 = new DistinguishedName("c=ch");
DistinguishedName dn2 = new DistinguishedName("C=CH");
System.out.println(dn1.equals(dn2));
System.out.println(dn1.hashCode() == dn2.hashCode());
which prints

true
false
