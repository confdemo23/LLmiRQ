Don&apos;t close the ServletInputStream in AbstractWebServiceConnection.receive
Some SAAJ implementations (Axis1 for instance) don&amp;apos;t read the entire message when using MessageFactory.createMessage(mimeHeaders,InputStream). Instead, they lazily instantiate the message. Therefore, closing the stream should be deferred to when the connection is closed.
