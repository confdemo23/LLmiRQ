Trying to set values in the newly added node (using XMLConfiguration) doesn&apos;t work
I&amp;apos;m using XMLConfiguration to manipulate my xml configuration file. Here is what I did,
1) Add a new node using "addNodes"
2) Save the configuration (using save method)
3) The new node gets added to the configuration file   &lt;--- Good
4) Now try setting a value in the just added new node using "setProperty" method.
5) Save the configuration (using save method)
6) The save method still writes the configuration that was in step 3        &lt;------- Bug
Looks like for some reason the save still holds the old configuration in cache that after the add nodes. If I call "reload" after each save then everything works fine. 
Just a setProperty on its own (without addNodes) work fine. It&amp;apos;s only when you try to addNodes and then do setProperty that this fails.
I&amp;apos;ve tried this with the latest nightly build (1.5), released 1.4 and 1.3 --&gt; all of them fail in this situation.
