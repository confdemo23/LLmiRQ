FlowDefinitionResourceFactory.getFlowId does not remove the classpath scheme if the resource implements ContextResource
In order to solve some other business requirements, I have created a custom Resource implementation that is returned when using "classpath*:" type resource patterns.  (It&amp;apos;s essentially a UrlResource that implements ContextResource).  However, when FlowDefinitionResourceFactory attempts to calculate the flow id, it removes the classpath scheme from the beginning of the base path for every instance (where base path is used) except for if the resource implements ContextResource.  Looking at the code, I don&amp;apos;t see any reason to skip it in this case, as in the common cases, invoking removeClasspathScheme will have no effect, while not artificially limiting any resource type that implements ContextResource.  
I am attaching a patch that does this.
