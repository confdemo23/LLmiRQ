LdapUtils#convertLdapException fails to convert some NamingExceptions to the narrowest possible type
LdapUtils#convertLdapException checks whether the parameter exception is instanceof each subtype of javax.naming.NamingException in alphabetical order. In particular, a Size- or TimeLimitExceededException will never be handled directly, since LimitExceededException, their common supertype, is handled first.
Trivial fix is to change the order of the checks, traversing up the hierarchy, rather than strictly alphabetical.
Better solution is some form of lookup. The current code is linear in the number of complexity. Storing the type token in a map with a factory would speed this up.
