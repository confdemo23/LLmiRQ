ConfigurationUtils.copy results in escaped "," characters no longer being escaped
When using ConfigurationUtils.copy to go between configuration formats any escaped out "," characters are put into the output configuration without the escape character.  This results in a different value being returned from getString calls as it now things the property is a list.  If 4 escape characters are used instead of the expected 1 then the copy will end up with the correct value, but then the original will end up with the escape character as part of the property value.  
Example:
SomeLongProperty=This is a test\, it is only a test

Ends up right in the copy, but not right in the original
SomeOtherProperty=This is also a test\\\\, it is also only a test

After copy:

Missing "\" before ","
SomeLongProperty=This is a test, it is only a test
SomeOtherProperty=This is also a test\, it is also only a test
