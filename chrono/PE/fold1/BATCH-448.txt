StaxEventItemWriter creates invalid xml for zero row documents
Copied from http://forum.springframework.org/showthread.php?t=51054 :
The seems to be a minor bug in org.springframework.batch.io.xml.StaxEventItemWrit er which causes it to generate invalid xml for output files that have zero rows e.g.
&lt;?xml version=&amp;apos;1.0&amp;apos; encoding=&amp;apos;UTF-8&amp;apos;?&gt;&lt;modules&lt;/modules&gt;
rather than
&lt;?xml version=&amp;apos;1.0&amp;apos; encoding=&amp;apos;UTF-8&amp;apos;?&gt;&lt;modules&gt;&lt;/modules&gt;
It looks like it is due to the frig in endDocument() which writes the end tag manually.
I have subclassed it in my project and overridden the endDocument() and added another event to the writer (writer.add(factory.createCharacters(""))), to get round this problem. This extra &amp;apos;useless&amp;apos; event seems to result in the startElement event being rendered correctly.
