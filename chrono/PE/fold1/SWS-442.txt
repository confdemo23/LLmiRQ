Generated WSDL file does not contain xmime attribute "expectedContentTypes" present in xsd files.
The attachment contains the following files,
       1)Normal0.xsd-- schema file containing "xmime:expectedContentTypes" attribute.
       2)Normal1.xsd-- schema file.
       3)MyService.wsdl-- WSDL file generated using "org.springframework.ws.wsdl.wsdl11.DefaultWsdl11Definition" class.
       4)spring-ws-servlet.xml-- Servlet config file used for generation of wsdl.
In spring-ws-servlet.xml file, 
    "org.springframework.ws.wsdl.wsdl11.DefaultWsdl11Definition" bean generates the wsdl file from the schemaCollection bean which uses the "org.springframework.xml.xsd.commons.CommonsXsdSchemaCollection" class.
The Normal0.xsd file,
     uses the xmime:expectedContentTypes="application/octet-stream" attribute to specify binary data, but the wsdl generated by "org.springframework.ws.wsdl.wsdl11.DefaultWsdl11Definition" class does not contain the xmime attribute.The generated wsdl file "MyService.wsdl" is attached.
Without xmime attribute in generated wsdl file the client code generation will not have Datahandler class.
It is also observed that when i use "org.springframework.xml.xsd.SimpleXsdSchema" class for specifying xsd file, the xmime attribute is reflected in wsdl file.But this class cannot be used for multiple xsd files.
Kindly let me know if more info is required,
Thanks in advance ,
