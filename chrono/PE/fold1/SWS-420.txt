AxiomSoapMessage + SOAP1.2 SoapAction
AxiomSoapMessage and SOAP1.2 SoapAction Problem.
I&amp;apos;m not sure, but as far as I read, in SOAP 1.2 the SoapAction parameter now part of Content-Type.
( http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-soap12-part2-20030624/#ietf-action ).
org.springframework.ws.soap.axiom.AxiomSoapMessage.writeTo(OutputStream outputStream) don&amp;apos;t extend the content-type header with the action paramater
in case of an soap1.2 message.
independent from the soap version, an SOAPAction header element is created.
