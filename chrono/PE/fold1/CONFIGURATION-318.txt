Constructor XMLConfiguration(HierarchicalConfiguration) loses the name of the root element
When creating an XMLConfiguration from another one using the copy constructor the name of the root element (i.e. the document element) is dropped. When the configuration is saved, the default root name ("configuration") is used.
