Null pointer while handling empty SOAP Body
I get a NullPointer exception when I issue a web service request with an empty input message. This results in an empty soap body which is totally legal (and works with other webservice frameworks)
With Spring-WS I get a NullPointerException. This is caused by the fact that a null object is sent to the transformer. IMO a check should be build in that does no transformation when there is an empty payload.
I know that I can get around this by implementing the MessageEndpoint interface but then I loose the transformation functionality e.d. I guess sending an empty message is normal functionality
Anyway, there is a workaround but it is a bit annoying
