FileUtils.touch should raise an IOException if I may not modify the file
The documentation states, that FileUtils.touch implements the UNIX-touch command. However I may successfully FileUtils.touch files like /etc/passwd, which is not allowed on the shell as normal user. 
Looking at the implementation, you should propably raise an IOException if the returnvalue of `file.setLastModified(System.currentTimeMillis());` is `false`.
