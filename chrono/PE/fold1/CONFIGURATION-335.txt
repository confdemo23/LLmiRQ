XMLConfiguration: Can&apos;t disable attribute splitting 
My XML configuration has the following attribute:
&lt;some-element some-attribute="

" /&gt;
But XML Configuration is trying to split this string and trims it after splitting. I don&amp;apos;t need this behaviour, but setting setDelimiterParsingDisabled() just changing delimeter to "|" and not disables attribute trimming.
Need either to disable trimming/splitting if setDelimiterParsingDisabled() is set to TRUE (incompatible change), or add something like setParseAttributesAsIs() that will prevent attributes to be trimmed and splitted
