HttpProducer discards response headers, if response code >= 300
In Camel 1.4.0, when a Web server sends an error page to HttpProducer, the Camel route can access the response headers that were sent by the server.  In Camel 1.5.0, these headers are discarded by HttpProducer, so the Camel route cannot access them.
Camel 1.5.0 also discards the content of the error page, but that was fixed in CAMEL-1083.
