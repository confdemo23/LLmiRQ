Global Transitions don&apos;t fire listeners
Global transitions do not appear to fire listeners.  I think that transitionExecuting should be fired.
I think that Flow.handleEvent should call "return context.execute(transition);" instead of  "return transition.execute(currentState, context);" as this will fire the events.
