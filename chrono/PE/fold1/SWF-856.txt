When using JSF getMaximumSeverity on the FlowFacesContext returns null even if a message has been added
If a converter creates a FacesMessage instance the message does appear as a result of the h:messages and h:message tags, but if the FacesContext is queried using the getMaximumSeverity method, the method returns null.  I was able to replicate the issue using the swf-booking-faces example by modifing the enterBookingDetails.xhtml.  I will attach the file once the issue has been created.  To reproduce, I removed the client side checking for one of the date entry boxes, and entered an incorrect date.  At the top of the page above the converter message should be the message "Please Correct the following errors:" which should only be rendered if any errors were detected.
