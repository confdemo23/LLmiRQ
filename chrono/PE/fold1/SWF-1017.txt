FlowFacesContext does not return the same FacesMessages instances
I am currently using a phase listener to fix up faces messages before they are displayed (a method described here http://www.oracle.com/technology/pub/articles/masterj2ee/j2ee_wk7.html).  Unfortunately FlowFacesContext creates a new FacesMessage adapted from spring messages on each call to FacesContext.getMessages().  This means that any set method called on the message is lost.
