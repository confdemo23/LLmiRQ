NPE when "mustUnderstand" attribute is in SOAP header and no Interceptors have been defined 
When the "mustUnderstand" attribute is set (to either "0" or "1") and no interceptors are defined a "PayloadRootQNameEndpointMapping" the org.springframework.ws.soap.server.SoapMessageDispatcher throw a NullPointerException when iterating over the mapped endpoint s Interceptors. 
Adding a "org.springframework.ws.server.endpoint.interceptor.PayloadLoggingInterceptor" temporarily fixes the problem (as the code just gets "any" EndpointInterceptor before checking via "instanceof" on SoapEndpointInterceptor.class).
Our Server might receive a SOAP Message with the mustUnderstand attribute set (to either "0" or "1") or not, but does not need to handle the attribute.
A nullpointer check would be appropriate here.
thx in advance.
