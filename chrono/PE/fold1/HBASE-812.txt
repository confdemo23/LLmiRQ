Compaction needs little better skip algo
Looking at this section of one of my compaction&amp;apos;s we have 3 files to compact the new algo is working great in my test but I see this below often we are skipping 2 out of the 3 files and compacting 1 file. 1 file is kind of a wast might as well just copy the file my suggestion is if there is only 1 file left after the new algo skips then just go on to the next column and skip the last file also. This will help improve compaction times a little more.
