CompositeItemReadListener, CompositeItemWriteListener using ChunkListeners?
The setListeners method in both composite listeners takes type ChunkListener[].... since we use 1.4.2, the list they get added to isn&amp;apos;t parameterized so this would only get caught at runtime when they are cast back  this seems very broken to me.
I think this should be ItemReadListener[] and ItemWriteListener[], respectively?
