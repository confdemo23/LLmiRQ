MockEndpont.expectedMinimumMessageCount() doesn&apos;t work right
In MockEndpoint.assertIsSatisfied(), don&amp;apos;t use the right counter for assertion.

      
      if (expectedMinimumCount &gt;= 0) {
            int receivedCounter = getReceivedCounter();
            assertTrue("Received message count " + receivedCounter + ", expected at least " + expectedCount, expectedCount &lt;= receivedCounter);
        }


it should be change to 

      
      if (expectedMinimumCount &gt;= 0) {
            int receivedCounter = getReceivedCounter();
            assertTrue("Received message count " + receivedCounter + ", expected at least " + expectedMinimumCount, expectedMinimumCount &lt;= receivedCounter);
        }
