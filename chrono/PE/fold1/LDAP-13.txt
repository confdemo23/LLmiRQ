DirContextAdapter.getModificationItems() returns password when password unchanged
Hello,

We have a Person.java pojo containing a password property of type byte[]. The password property is set to and from the Sun Directory Server using a ContextMapper/ContextAssembler implementation.
Problem: DirContextAdapter.getModificationsItems() always returns the password attribute as an updated attribute. This is due to byte arrays having a different hashcode despite identical content. Therefore b1[].equals(b2[]) returns false.

This could be a problem say if:

Service subscriber 1 gets a handle to a Person pojo
Service subscriber 2 gets a handle to a Person pojo, updates password attribute and saves.
Service subscriber 1 updates "golden rating" attribute and saves. The new password is blown away.

Suggested Solution: Perhaps DirContextAdapter.isChanged() should use Arrays.equals(byte[], byte[]) for attributes of type byte[]. 
Best Regards,
