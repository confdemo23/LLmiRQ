Exchange.getOut() not returning (blocking till timeout) when ExchangePattern.InOut used as well as message headers and exchange properties not passed when a Camel Mina used.
Exchange.getOut() not returning (blocking till timeout) when ExchangePattern.InOut used. Additionally, message properties and exchange headers does not seem to be passed when using MINA TCP communication. In direct pojo or bean, everything seems working.
