IllegalArgumentException "faultString cannot be empty"
If there is a runtime exception on the server-side that doesn&amp;apos;t have a message (e.g. NullPointerException) the client side
gets an IllegalArgumentException "faultString cannot be empty". The exception seems to be coming from SaajSoap11Body.java, line 50. 
Could this be configured so the client always gets SOAP response even if the server had a runtime exception?
Also in the above scenario the server-side doesn&amp;apos;t show the original runtime exception but instead hides it by showing the IllegalArgumentException only.
