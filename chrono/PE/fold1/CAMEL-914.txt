Camel Maven plugin should not look for routes in target/test-classes
Currently the Maven Plugin attempts to load Camel Routes from both target/classes and target/test-classes.  This causes an issue when you have the same package defined for testing as you have in your Camel Context.  An example problem is using a super class for a test which is only available a test dependency which results in a ClassNotFoundException.
I would propose one of the following:

Prevent the plugin from using target/test-classes altogther
Add a mojo parameter to allow for routes under test-classes to be scanned
	
This should default to False
If this parameter is set to True then the plugin should add dependencies marked as "test" to the classpath
