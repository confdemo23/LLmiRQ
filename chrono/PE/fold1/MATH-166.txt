Special functions not very accurate
The Gamma and Beta functions return values in double precision but the default epsilon is set to 10e-9. I think that the default should be set to the highest possible accuracy, as this is what I&amp;apos;d expect to be returned by a double precision routine. Note that the erf function already uses a call to Gamma.regularizedGammaP with an epsilon of 1.0e-15.
