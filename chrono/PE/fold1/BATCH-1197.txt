Rerunning a job sometimes creates new job instance
An attempt to rerun stopped job using following code sometimes leads to creation of new JobInstance with same JOB_KEY but with entries in different order.
List&lt;JobInstance&gt; jobInstances = jobExplorer.getJobInstances(jobName, 0, 1);
if (!jobInstances.isEmpty()) {
    jobLauncher.run(job, jobInstances.get(0).getJobParameters());
}
I tried to debug it and I think the problem may be in JdbcJobInstanceDao.FIND_PARAMS_FROM_ID used in getJobParameters(). This query relies on the fact that job parameters are retrieved from database in same order as they have been inserted - which does not have to be true. Maybe ordering by job parameter name would help. Maybe it would be best to add this behavior to the JobParameters instead of relying on LinkedHashMap and insert order.
