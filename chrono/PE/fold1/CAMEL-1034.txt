Messages in StreamResequencer between 2 ActiveMQ queues seem to be stuck
Perhaps some subtle configuration issue, but a Camel stream resequencer that is a route between 2 ActiveMQ queues fails to deliver all ordered messages. In fact, using the defaults for a StreamResequencer only 1 out of 100 messages are delivered. However, all 100 messages have been removed from the Producer queue by the resequencer and are not moved to the consumer queue either (even unordered). 
Relevant points:

Broker is run external to Camel route (non-embedded, no VM transport)
Producer is a Camel ProducerTemplate
Consumer is a Camel route that listens on another delivery queue and delivers message to a simple stdout Processor
Resequencer uses stream defaults (100, 1000ms)
Trace warns of some Converter override (see attached trace) and throws a breadcrumb error
Resequencer fails delivery whether using body (long) or seqnum header (long)
all JMS components are configured for AutoAcks
