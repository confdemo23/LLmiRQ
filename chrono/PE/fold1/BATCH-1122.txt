StaxEventWriter.startDocument() needs to be protected
The method startDocument() in org.springframework.batch.item.xml.StaxEventWriter is private, whereas its javadoc mentions "[...]If this is not sufficient for you, simply override this method."
This prevents one to cleanly override the creation of the root tag.
The simple fix is to make the method protected, as is endDocument().
