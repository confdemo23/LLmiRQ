PropertiesConfiguration.save() does not support escaping the escape character
When a new property is added to a PropertiesConfiguration, it is possible to escape the escaping character for list delimiters, e.g.
conf.addProperty("test.dirs", "C:\\Temp\\\\,D:\\Data");
Here the Backslash after Temp must be escaped, otherwise the list delimiter won&amp;apos;t be recognized. This works, but when the configuration is saved and loaded again, the backslash that escapes the escape character is dropped. The property is then treated as a single value property with an escaped list delimiter.
