CombinedConfiguration fire EVENT_COMBINED_INVALIDATE even before the contained configuration is updated
CombinedConfiguration.configurationChanged doesn&amp;apos;t check the !event.isBeforeUpdate() and trigger the invalidate call. The invalidate call fire the EVENT_COMBINED_INVALIDATE. so now when a contained config is changed, EVENT_COMBINED_INVALIDATE is fired twice by the CombinedConfiguration. However it should only fire it after the contained FileConfiguration is updated.
