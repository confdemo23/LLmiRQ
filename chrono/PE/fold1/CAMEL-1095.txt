camel-jetty - Content-Type should be set on response if provided as OUT header
The Content-Type is not set in HttpBinding if an end-user has provided one as a OUT header.
So if an user exposes a Jetty service and lets requests fly in that is text/plain and want to return a response that is image/jpeg or the likes the content type can not be set as:
            exchange.getOut().setHeader("Content-Type", "image/jpeg");
