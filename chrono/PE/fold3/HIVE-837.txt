virtual column support (filename) in hive
Copying from some mails:
I am dumping files into a hive partion on five minute intervals. I am using LOAD DATA into a partition.
weblogs
web1.00
web1.05
web1.10
...
web2.00
web2.05
web1.10
....
Things that would be useful..
Select files from the folder with a regex or exact name
select * FROM logs where FILENAME LIKE(WEB1*)
select * FROM LOGS WHERE FILENAME=web2.00
Also it would be nice to be able to select offsets in a file, this would make sense with appends
select * from logs WHERE FILENAME=web2.00 FROMOFFSET=454644 [TOOFFSET=]
select  
substr(filename, 4, 7) as  class_A, 
substr(filename,  8, 10) as class_B
count( x ) as cnt
from FOO
group by
substr(filename, 4, 7), 
substr(filename,  8, 10) ;
Hive should support virtual columns
