Add authentication-success-handler-ref attribute to <remember-me> tag
IMHO, I think it would be extremely helpful to some web developers to be able to specify a specific page to be loaded when a user is "logged in" via rememberMeServices, right out of the box. This is especially true for developers who set the always-use-default-target="true" in the &lt;form-login&gt; tag.  If you want the &lt;remember-me&gt; tag to act in the same manor, the learning curve gets pretty steep.
It would also be useful if the user&amp;apos;s session always needs to be re-iniated by the web application after an expired session.  Having the target-url go to a page the tells the user their session has expired, they are being redirected to a "start page", and automatically logged-in is helpful.
