DefaultStepExecutionAggregator can simply ignore null or empty input
Current implementation of DefaultStepExecutionAggregator validates the arguments and restricts null or empty sets of executions. In my opinion the validation is too strict and prohibit usage of DefaultStepExecutionAggregator in various cases when using namespace support for partitions (there is no possibility to set the aggregator when using batch namespace). I have implementation of the partitioner that ignores gridSize and in certain occasions return empty map of executions. I believe the framework should be able to deal with such situations.
The strict validation seems odd to me also in context of other default components provided by the framework to deal with partitioning. For instance, TaskExecutorPartitionHandler can process empty collections of executions returned by the splitter. SimpleStepExecutionSplitter is also fine.
