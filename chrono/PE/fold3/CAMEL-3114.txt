url encoding goes wrong in org.apache.camel.component.rss.RssComponent#afterConfiguration
The method org.apache.camel.component.rss.RssComponent#afterConfiguration creates the Url that will be used to fetch the rss feed. We find that with some url&amp;apos;s url encoding goes wrong.
consider this url: http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?id=23353282@N05&amp;tags=lowlands&amp;lang=en-us&amp;format=rss_200
AfterConfiguration() calls org.apache.camel.util.URISupport#createRemainingURI This method first calls org.apache.camel.util.URISupport#createQueryString, which is a method that will iterate over a map of request parameters, escape each param name and value using java.net.URLEncoder#encode, and put them together with all the &amp; and = stuff to form the query string.
Then it calls org.apache.camel.util.URISupport#createURIWithQuery Which is a method that takes a URI (the base url) and the constructed query string, and simply creates a new URI with that, returning the toString() output from that.
So this is what the output of this procedure looks like: http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?format=rss_200&amp;id=23353282%2540N05&amp;lang=en-us&amp;tags=lowlands
1 the @ sign was escaped by org.apache.camel.util.URISupport#createQueryString, creating a query string like: id=23353282%40N05&amp;tags=lowlands&amp;lang=en-us&amp;format=rss_200 (which is good)
2 the URI constructor then finds the % in %40 and escapes that again! creating a url like: http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?format=rss_200&amp;id=23353282%2540N05&amp;lang=en-us&amp;tags=lowlands 
Which predictably fails...
I did some tests with the URI constructor, and it seems it only escapes % chars, everything else is left alone.
I attach a groovy script that demonstrates the problem
