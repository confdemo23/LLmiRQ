Make RabbitAdmin.deleteQueue() return boolean result
Make RabbitAdmin.deleteQueue() return boolean: currently it fails if the queue didn&amp;apos;t exist, but it would be nicer really to simply ignore the exception and return false.  It would save us having to do this everywhere:






try {




	admin.deleteQueue("test.queue");




} catch (AmqpIOException e) {




	// Ignore (queue didn&amp;apos;t exist)




}
