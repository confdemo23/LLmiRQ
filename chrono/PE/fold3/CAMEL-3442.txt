JBI ClassLoading issue in SMX 4.x in OsgiPackageScanClassResolver
CAMEL-3302 introduced a fallback when using JBI in Apache ServiceMix 4.x.
However it may lead to an issue with ConcurrentModificationException when traversing the list of classloaders.



            for (ClassLoader classLoader : super.getClassLoaders()) {

                if (!isOsgiClassloader(classLoader)) {

                    find(test, packageName, classLoader, classes);

                }

            }  



The for loop is line 62 which causes the exception.
