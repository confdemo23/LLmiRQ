AbstractItdMetadataProvider does not skip processing if the governor&apos;s type metadata is invalid
AbstractItdMetadataProvider fails to consider if the governor&amp;apos;s type metadata was returned as non-null but was invalid. The change should be:






-               if (governorPhysicalTypeMetadata == null) {




+               if (governorPhysicalTypeMetadata == null || !governorPhysicalTypeMetadata.isValid()) {
