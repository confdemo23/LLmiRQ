HttpSessionSecurityContextRepository should clear session context when current context is anonmous or empty
I have written a LogoutFilter which does not redirect to a logout page. It just logs out the user and goes on with the filter chain.
(it&amp;apos;s needed because we have different areas and the user should be logged out when switching to another "area")
Before it comes to saving the security context with HttpSessionSecurityContextRepository the anonymousFilter sets an AnonymousAuthentication. So when it comes to saving the context, it is not saved.
This is because of this code in HttpSessionSecurityContextRepository
protected void saveContext(SecurityContext context) {
            // See SEC-776
   if (authenticationTrustResolver.isAnonymous(context.getAuthentication())) {
                if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) 
{
                    logger.debug("SecurityContext contents are anonymous - context will not be stored in HttpSession. ");
                }
                return;
    }
BTW my LogoutFilter is configured with invalidateHttpSession=false otherwise this bug wouldn&amp;apos;t occur i guess.
So imho, there should be another check to see what is actually saved in the session.
