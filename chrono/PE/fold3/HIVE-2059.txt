Add datanucleus.identifierFactory property to HiveConf to avoid unintentional MetaStore Schema corruption
Hive 0.6.0 we upgraded the version of DataNucleus from 1.0 to 2.0, which changed some of the defaults for how field names get mapped to datastore identifiers. This was problem was resolved in HIVE-1435 by setting datanucleus.identifierFactory=datanucleus in hive-default.xml
However, this property definition was not added to HiveConf. This can result in schema corruption if the user upgrades from Hive 0.5.0 to 0.6.0 or 0.7.0 and retains the Hive 0.5.0 version hive-default.xml on their classpath.
