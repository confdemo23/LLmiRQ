Underscore (_) incorrectly rejected as first character by JavaType
Right now we can&amp;apos;t create org.springframework.roo.model.JavaType when the class name begins with underscore (_). To avoid this problem I&amp;apos;ve modified my roo copy commenting the rule that&amp;apos;s enforcing the class name to start with capital letter.
Use case: we generate some metadata class associated with entity class. If original class is called com.contraza.test.domain.User then we generate com.contraza.test.domain.metadata._User (took the idea from JPA2 generated metadata).
