List of DeclaredFieldAnnotationDetails passed to addFieldAnnotation method of ItdTypeDetailsBuilder incorrectly uses List.contains() to check for presented annotation
The method addFieldAnnotation of ItdTypeDetails checks for the existence of an annotation using the java.util.List contains method. This will not work as the objects compared will never be equal. The solution is to use MemberFindingUtils.getAnnotationOfType(..) instead.
