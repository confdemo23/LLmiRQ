Javadoc for PresentFilter and NotPresentFilter is incorrect
The example in the Javadoc for NotPresentFilter takes "foo*" as parameter 
(http://static.springsource.org/spring-ldap/docs/1.3.x/apidocs/org/springframework/ldap/filter/NotPresentFilter.html).
It should be corrected to take just "foo" instead. "foo*" parameter would produce (!(foo*=*))
It is the same case with PresentFilter (http://static.springsource.org/spring-ldap/docs/1.3.x/apidocs/org/springframework/ldap/filter/PresentFilter.html)
