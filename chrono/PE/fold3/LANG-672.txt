Doc bug in DateUtils#ceiling

For example, if you had the datetime of 28 Mar 2002

     * 13:45:01.231, if you passed with HOUR, it would return 28 Mar

     * 2002 13:00:00.000.  If this was passed with MONTH, it would

     * return 1 Mar 2002 0:00:00.000. 

Looks like copy-paste from truncate. (the dates are incorrect)
