ClassLoader set on a WebApplicationContext is used to load beans but not to inject Class properties which uses the current thread&apos;s context ClassLoader
Set a ClassLoader set on a WebApplicationContext that is NOT the current thread&amp;apos;s ClassLoader.
This ClassLoader is used to load beans.
But if you try to inject Class properties into those beans then it uses the current thread&amp;apos;s context ClassLoader.
The same ClassLoader should be used in both cases - ideally the one set on the WebApplicationContext.
org.springframework.beans.propertyeditors.ClassEditor.setAsText calls ClassUtils.forName(String className).
This method is hardwired to use the current thread&amp;apos;s context ClassLoader.
Any call to ClassUtils.forName(String className)  should be changed to the version that accepts a ClassLoader.
Thanks.
