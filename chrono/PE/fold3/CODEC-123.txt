ColognePhonetic Javadoc should use HTML entities for special characters.
The ColognePhonetic class contains Javadoc with umlauts and other characters that do not always play well in editors. Change these characters to HTML entities. This means we should also be able to remove the UTF-8 settings in the POM for Javadoc.
