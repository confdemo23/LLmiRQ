SMPP component should set the final status header for delivery notifications
The camel-smpp comonent should set the final status that is provided by the delivery receipt from the SMSC.
Currently the status header is not set, but can easily be added by making a call to smscDeliveryReceipt.getFinalStatus() and setting the header CamelSmppStatus on the camel message (as documented on the site http://camel.apache.org/smpp.html.
Patch provided.
