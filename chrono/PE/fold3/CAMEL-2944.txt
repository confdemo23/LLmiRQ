StreamCache - File spooled stream cache does not work well on Windows due not closing file resource
Windows is pesky about deleting files which may have an open stream hanging. While other OS is capable of that.
SplitterStreamCacheTest fails on windows due this issue.
The logic in CachedOutputStream should better leverage the Synchronization to be able to close the streams at the end.
Also various DOM converters will automatic closes input streams when converting to DOM. The only reliable mechanism is Camels synchronization which is invoked when the Exchange is done. And thus the time where we can cleanup.
