XSS vulnerability in file download
If there is an error the filename is by default not escaped in the html output.  A workaround for existing users is to provide a MessageSource with the relevant error codes from the FileController (file.download.missing and file.download.failed) so that the default text is not used. The fix is easy, and it only applies to the @RequestMapping with the wildcard "**" url pattern (others are rejected by the dispatcher).
