WebAuthenticatonDetails.doPopulateAdditionalInformation should be removed
I have a class that extends org.springframework.security.web.authentication.WebAuthenticationDetails class and implements org.springframework.security.core.authority.GrantedAuthoritiesContainer.
It overrides the method doPopulateAdditionalInformation to retrieve the additional information from the request headers.
When running the application I receive an illegalArgumentException thrown from Assert.notNull, with the message "Cannot pass a null GrantedAuthority collection".
Investigating this showed that the WebAuthenticationDetails constructor calls doPopulateAdditionalInformation as its last step, this does initialize my members with correct values, but after the constructor returns, my derived class constructor gets called, re-initializing the fields again, re-setting my List&lt;GrantedAuthority&gt; back to null.
