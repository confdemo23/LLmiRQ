MultiResourceItemWriter creates an empty file if the number of item to write is a multiple of itemCountLimitPerResource
MultiResourceItemWriter creates files on the filesystem when setting the resource to the delegate. If the number of items to write is a multiple of itemCountLimitPerResource, the last file will be created, but nothing will be written into it.
The attached patch defers the file creation in the write method.
