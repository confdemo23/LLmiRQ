Incorrect distribution of methods between FlowApplication and Jsf2FlowApplication
Some JSF 1.2 specific methods were erroneously added to Jsf2FlowApplication instead of FlowApplication. This causes backwards compatibility issues with Apache MyFaces 1.2 where some of these methods throw UnsupportedOperationException.
