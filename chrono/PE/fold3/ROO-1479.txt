DBRE on a DB2400 datasource throwing IllegalArgumentException JDBC driver not available for &apos;com.ibm.as400.access.AS400JDBCDriver&apos;
Attempting to DBRE on a DB2400 datasource fails with java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: JDBC driver not available for &amp;apos;com.ibm.as400.access.AS400JDBCDriver&amp;apos;.
Have attempted to build Roo M4 from Git and copy the org.springframework.roo.wrapping.jtopen-6.7.0.0001.jar dependency into the M3 bundle directory.  Have also tried DBRE right from M4, but both give the same result.
