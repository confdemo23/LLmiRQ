A custom partitioner no longer restart the job properly upon failure
The changes in BATCH-1531 introduced a regression. If the partitions are not named partition0, partition1, partition2, Spring Batch considers that the execution does not exist and start a fresh new instance without calling the partitioner, which fails since the partitioner sets mandatory value for the partition to run properly.
For the record we use the following
public static final String PARTITION_PREFIX = "partition-";
// ...
final String partitionNumberFormat = "%0" + String.valueOf(gridSize).length() + "d";
// for partition i
final String partitionName = PARTITION_PREFIX + String.format(partitionNumberFormat, i);
