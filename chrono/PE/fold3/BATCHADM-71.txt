Protect admin console from CannotResolveClassException when deserializing from meta data tables
When using Spring Batch Admin Console to view job executions from different JVMs causes a CannotResolveClassException from XStream. 
Specifically, jobs saving custom classes to the job execution will have serialized objects stored in the meta data tables. When viewing the job execution in Spring Batch Admin Console, the console will attempt to deserialize these objects, and if the class is not available at runtime, the above exception will be thrown, causing an error to appear instead of the job execution.
As the deserialized objects are not used by the admin console, there is no reason to report this error and the exception can be caught and ignored or logged.
