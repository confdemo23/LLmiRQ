PollingFileMonitorService never publishes notified file changes if notification was under an unmonitored file path
We are developing an Add-on to include some of the *nix shell commands to use inside of the Roo shell like mkdir, rmdir, rm, cp, mv, ls, tree.
The Add-on creates a directory with the command: create dir. 
The Roo shell is hanged in a loop when is no project defined in the working directory.
See the readme.txt file of the project for more information.
Thanks.
