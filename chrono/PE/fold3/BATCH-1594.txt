StepListenerSupport implements method onErrorInStep which is not declared in any of the implemented interfaces
The onErrorInStep method is not declared in any of the listener interfaces, nor is it called as far as I can see from the code executing steps. onErrorInStep was removed from the StepExecutionListener in changeset 2338 and jira BATCH-825.
While the onErrorInStep method in StepListenerSupport will not cause problems directly, it is misleading for developers extending StepListenerSupport.
(When editing the StepListenerSupport, you might want to update the non-javadoc referencing StepListener to reference StepExecutionListener instead as well)
