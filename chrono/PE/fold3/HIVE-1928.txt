GRANT/REVOKE should handle privileges as tokens, not identifiers
The grammar for the GRANT and REVOKE Privileges statements currently handle the list of privileges as a list of
identifiers. Since most of the privileges are also keywords in the HQL grammar this requires users
to individually quote-escape each of the privileges, e.g:



grant `Create` on table authorization_part to user hive_test_user;

grant `Update` on table authorization_part to user hive_test_user;

grant `Drop` on table authorization_part to user hive_test_user;

grant `select` on table src to user hive_test_user;



Both MySQL and the SQL standard treat privileges as tokens. Hive should do the same.
