FastMath min and max fail with (Infinity,-Infinity) and (0,0, -0.0)
FastMath min and max fail with (Infinity,-Infinity) and (0,0, -0.0):
min(float 0.0, float -0.0) expected -0.0 actual 0.0
min(float Infinity, float -Infinity) expected -Infinity actual NaN
max(float 0.0, float -0.0) expected 0.0 actual -0.0
max(float Infinity, float -Infinity) expected Infinity actual NaN
Similarly for the double versions.
The Infinity failures are because the code uses Float.isNaN(a + b) which gives NaN when +/1- Infinity are added together.
