SFTP throws ResolveEndpointFailedException when "ftpClient.connectionTimeout" option is provided
Currently, SFTP throws an ResolveEndpointFailed exception if the option "ftpClient.connectionTimeout" is provided as a part of the URI. This could be fixed by calling the Session.connect(int timeout) method of JSCH. Some investigation reveals that this method eventually calls Socket.setSoTimeout(int timeout), which implies that the time unit of the timeout is milliseconds.

Example:
sftp://user@host/dir?password=secret&amp;ftpClient.connectionTimeout=30000&amp;disconnect=true&amp;passiveMode=true
ResolveEndpointFailedException:
[...]
There are 1 parameters that couldn&amp;apos;t be set on the endpoint. Check the uri if the parameters are spelt correctly and that they are properties of the endpoint. Unknown parameters=[
{ftpClient.connectionTimeout=30000}
