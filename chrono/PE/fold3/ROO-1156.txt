Exceptions are caused by the org.springframework.roo.startlevel.Activator during shutdown
The Activator for the startlevel module is causing exceptions during shutdown. This is because it is attempting to obtain a service (via the service reference) but the service is no longer available. This was discovered due to the extended OSGi logging added as part of ROO-1155.
