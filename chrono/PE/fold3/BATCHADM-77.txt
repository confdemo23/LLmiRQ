StepExecution JMX and UI stats should be scoped by owning Job.
Using CommandLineJobRunner it is possible to re-use a job definition in different contexts, differentiating runs using the JobRegistryBeanPostProcessor.groupName feature.
If I run instances of  jobA consisting of Step.id="step1" and then run instances of  jobB - also consisting of Step.id="step1"  then the cumulative stats for step1 will consist of all executions of the step regardless of the job context in which they were run. 
The stepExecution stats for step1 should be grouped by owning Job.jobName so that there is distinct view of jobA.step1 stats and jobB.step1 stats.
This should also be reflected in the JMX stats.
