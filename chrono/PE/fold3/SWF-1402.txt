FlowViewResponseStateManager should call delegate isPostback()
The new FlowViewResponseStateManager classes uses a delegate for most method calls but lets .isPostback fall through to the super class.
I think that this may cause some problems for non JSF requests as there is a difference between ResponseStateManager (the superclass):
    public boolean isPostback(FacesContext context) 
{
        return (!context.getExternalContext().getRequestParameterMap().isEmpty());
    }

and ResponseStateManagerImpl (the delegate)
    public boolean isPostback(FacesContext context) 
{
        return context.getExternalContext().getRequestParameterMap().
              containsKey(ResponseStateManager.VIEW_STATE_PARAM);
    }

That means any URL with a parameter is considered a postback.
FlowViewResponseStateManager should probably use:
	public boolean isPostback(FacesContext context) 
{
		return delegate.isPostback(context);
	}


It may also be worth considering changing FlowRenderKit.getResponseStateManager() to only return FlowViewResponseStateManager when JsfUtils.isFlowRequest() returns true.
