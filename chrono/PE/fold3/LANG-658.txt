Some Entitys like &Ouml; are not matched properly against its ISO8859-1 representation
In EntityArrays 
In
 private static final String[][] ISO8859_1_ESCAPE 
some matching is wrong, for example

 

        {"\u00D7", "&amp;Ouml;"}, //  - uppercase O, umlaut

        {"\u00D8", "&amp;times;"}, // multiplication sign



but this must be   

 

       {"\u00D6", "&amp;Ouml;"}, //  - uppercase O, umlaut

        {"\u00D7", "&amp;times;"}, // multiplication sign



according to http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/block/latin_supplement/list.htm
First look:
u00CA is missing in the array and all following entries are matched wrong by an offset of 1.
