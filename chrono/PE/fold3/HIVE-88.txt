hadoop doesn&apos;t use conf/hive-log4j.properties
hadoop-0.20.0-dev-core.jar contains log4j.properties file, and I think that&amp;apos;s the one hadoop is picking up. I modified both conf/hive-log4j.properties and hadoopcore/conf/log4j.properties, but hadoop still printed INFO messages to stderr.

Hello,
When I do "ant test" under ql directory, I get many log messages to stderr.
 [junit] 08/11/28 19:04:14 INFO exec.MapOperator: Got partitions: null
[junit] 08/11/28 19:04:14 INFO exec.ReduceSinkOperator: Initializing Self
[junit] 08/11/28 19:04:14 INFO exec.ReduceSinkOperator: Using tag = -1

[junit] 08/11/28 19:04:14 INFO thrift.TBinarySortableProtocol:

   ....
I tried setting log level to ERROR in conf/hive-log4j.properties, but these info lines still show up. How can I get rid of them?
Thanks!

When we run the tests - we run in hadoop &amp;apos;local&amp;apos; mode - and in this mode, we run map-reduce jobs by invoking &amp;apos;hadoop jar ... ExecDriver&amp;apos; cmd line. this was done because we had some issues submitting map-reduce jobs directly (from same jvm) in local mode that we could not resolve.
The issue is that when we invoke &amp;apos;hadoop jar ... ExecDriver&amp;apos; - we don&amp;apos;t control log4j via hive-log4j. one thing u can try is changing the hadoop&amp;apos;s log4j.properties that hive is picking up (probably hadoopcore/conf/log4j.properties).
Revisiting this after a long time - I think this can be fixed with some changes to MapRedTask.java (need to add hive-log4j.properties to hadoop classpath here and then reset log4j using this in execdriver). Feel free to file a jira if this is too irritating ..
