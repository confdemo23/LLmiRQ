PublishEventNotifier - Should not emit events during startup/shutdown and not spawn new events when processing event
When an event is being send to an endpoint using PublishEventNotifier it may create new events, and so forth. This causes a flood of events.
Also further complications occur during start/shutdown of Camel when you send events to routes, which are then being graceful shutdown. Therefore this event notifier should only publish if camel is fully started and running.
