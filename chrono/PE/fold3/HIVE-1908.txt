FileHandler leak on partial iteration of the resultset. 
If the "resultset" is not iterated completely ,  one filehandler is leaking
Ex: We need only first row. This case one resource is leaking





ResultSet resultSet = createStatement.executeQuery("select * from sampletable");



if (resultSet.next())

{

	System.out.println(resultSet.getString(1)+"   "+resultSet.getString(2));

} 





Command used for checking the filehandlers
