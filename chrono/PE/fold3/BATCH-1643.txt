Unpredictable binding in BeanWrapperFieldSetMapper because of "fuzzy" property matching
This bug has two distinct symptoms, due to the permissiveness of the fuzzy matching in BeanWrapperFieldSetMapper#findPropertyName().  See the attached Unit test and included javadocs.  Basically, the fuzzy matching can cause multiple columns of the input to match the same target bean property, thus wrongly failing to throw NotWritablePropertyException in some cases, and this also makes it unpredictable which competing 
{@link FieldSet}
 value will actually be set into the target bean property.
As a minimal work-around it would be nice to be able to turn off fuzzy matching (e.g. by exposing distanceLimit as a configurable property).  I would also suggest  defaulting its value to 0 instead of 5, as it is pretty dangerous.
