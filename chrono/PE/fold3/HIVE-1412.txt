CombineHiveInputFormat bug on tablesample
CombineHiveInputFormat should combine all files inside one partition to form a split but should not takes files cross partition boundary. This works for regular table and partitions since all input paths are directory. However this breaks when the input is files (in which case tablesample could be the use case). CombineHiveInputFormat should adjust to the case when input could also be non-directories.
