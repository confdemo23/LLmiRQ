Undo Functionality Should clean up its temp files?
I believe Roo is generating a tremendous amount of temp files in order to Undo actions when an error occurs.  These temp files are never removed so the temp directory continues to grow bigger and bigger.
Since Roo doesn&amp;apos;t allow the user to "Undo" commands, this Undo functionality is used only internally.  I would assume that the temp files are created so if an error occurs processing a command any actions taken before the error occurred are able to be rolledback (or Undone).
I would think it is reasonable to say if the command was performed without error then the undo files should be removed after the command completes.
This would stop the ever growing temp directory.
An example of the impact: I started a roo project on 9/13 and as of today there are 112544 File(s) 689,963,308 bytes in roo temp files dated from 9/13 to 10/13.
Same project on the computer that I did the actual development on there were over 6gb of the temp files.

successfully running the roo security setup on a project generated 2047 temp files.
successfully running roo perform tests on the same project generated 654 File(s) 10,987,854 bytes
So everytime perform tests is executed it generates another 654 File(s) 10,987,854 bytes
Not exactly sure why perform tests would need Undo functionality since none of the roo managed files are being changed during this command.
Anyway, just thought I would post it so someone with a lot more knowledge could at least take a look at it.
