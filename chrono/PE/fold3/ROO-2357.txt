Error with the generated code in *Roo_Controller.aj, *Roo_DataOnDemand.aj and *Roo_IntegrationTest.aj when an entity class extends an other entiy class
The code generated with in the aspectJ files has a mix of problems that mean that the project will not compile, for example with in the controller it is calling the mothod findAllPolicys from the parent class rather than calling findAllMotorPolicys, and this is then generating a type conversion error as the List&lt;MotorPolicy&gt; is what is expected but List&lt;Policy&gt; is what is being returned. This is also happening in the IntegrationTest aspects and DataOnDemand. The other issue is that in the DataOnDemand aspects the set methods used to propulate the data is being set with the parameters of ( Policy , int ) rather than ( MotorPolicy, int ). I will attach some of the class and aspect files from the project to show examples as to what is happening.
