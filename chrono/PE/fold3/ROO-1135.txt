The Menu entries generated do not split CamelCase entity names the same way that labels do.
If you create entities that have a camel case name such as "BaseUser", when the application.properties file gets an entry that references that entity in a label, it is smart enough to split the entity name into two words like "Base User", however when an entry is added that references that entity in a menu the subsequent capital letters get converted to lowercase like "Baseuser".
Obviously, the simple work around is to edit the application.properties file after the generation of the entity, but if you happen to be working on the code that deals with this anyway, you might want to fix this while you&amp;apos;re in there.
