XmlStreamReader consumes the stream during encoding detection
XmlStreamReader reads the underlying InputStream to try and detect the encoding. However once that process is done the bytes read from the stream should still be available to be read - this was accidentally broken in r1004882 by creating the underlying reader with the original InputStream, rather than the wrapped streams used to detect encoding.
