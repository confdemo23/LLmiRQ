Precision.EPSILON: wrong documentation
The documentation of the Field EPSILON in class org.apache.commons.math3.util.Precision states, that EPSILON is the smallest positive number such that 1 - EPSILON is not numerically equal to 1, and its value is defined as 1.1102230246251565E-16.
However, this is NOT the smallest positive number with this property.
Consider the following program:



public class Eps {

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    double e = Double.longBitsToDouble(0x3c90000000000001L);

	double e1 = 1-e;

	System.out.println(e);

	System.out.println(1-e);

	System.out.println(1-e != 1);

  }

}



The output is:



% java Eps

5.551115123125784E-17

0.9999999999999999

true



This proves, that there are smaller positive numbers with the property that 1-eps != 1.
I propose not to change the constant value, but to update the documentation. The value Precision.EPSILON is 
an upper bound on the relative error which occurs when a real number is
rounded to its nearest Double floating-point number. I propose to update 
the api docs in this sense.
