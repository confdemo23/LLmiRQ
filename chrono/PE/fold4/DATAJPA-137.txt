deleteAll() - generated bulk delete queries do not respect cascade delete
delete from %s x does not respect cascade delete operations (with hibernate at least).
Performing:






for(T entity : this.findAll()) {




    delete(entity);




}






Operates as expected - though obviously looses the efficiency of the bulk query.
Additionally, attempting to do:






delete(findAll())






Will fail if there is a cascade delete dependency between objects of the same type:
"deleted instance passed to merge"
As the check:






em.remove(em.contains(entity) ? entity : em.merge(entity));






Correctly establishes the entity no longer exists and attempts to do a merge instead (not entirely sure why as if it doesn&amp;apos;t exist in the persistence context and we&amp;apos;re attempting to delete it a merge has no purpose?). Surely:






if(em.contains(entity)) {




    em.remove(entity);




}






Is the correct functionality here?
