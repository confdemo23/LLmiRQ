Support for validation groups in @Valid used by spring MVC
It would be useful to be able to use validation groups in spring MVC as specified by JSR-303. With the improvement it should be possible to write something like: 
@RequestMapping("/foo", method=RequestMethod.POST)
public void processFoo(@Valid(groups=
{Default.class, MyValidationGroup.class}
) Foo foo) 
{ ... }
