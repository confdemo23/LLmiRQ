SessionRegistry and refreshLastRequest
It seems that refreshLastRequest(String sessionId) in the SessionRegistry class is not called by the security framework anywhere, but refreshLastRequest() is called on the SessionInformation object instead. It took me a few minutes to figure out why the last refresh date wasn&amp;apos;t being updated on my custom session registry.
