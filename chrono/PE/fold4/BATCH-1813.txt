BeanWrapperFieldSetMapper properties caching is broken
The fix for BATCH-1709 broke the caching of the property name mapping cache in getBeanProperties().
On the first run through an empty ConcurrentHashMap is put in "propertiesMatched" at the top of getBeanProperties(), the "matches" Map is then seeded with this empty ConcurrentHashMap but at the bottom of getBeanProperties the updated "matches" Map isn&amp;apos;t written back to that ConcurrentHashMap.
On large numbers of items with a lot of properties, this really hurts performance.
