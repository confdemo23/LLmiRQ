ProviderSignInController should automatically sync and refresh the access token upon every sign in.
Currently a user can log in successfully through the ProviderSignInController, but upon calling connection.sync() an exception is thrown due to stale session data.   
org.springframework.social.NotAuthorizedException: Error validating access token: Session does not match current stored session. This may be because the user changed the password since the time the session was created or Facebook has changed the session for security reasons.
It should not be possible to sign in and not be able to perform functions on behalf of the user.  The connection should be updated every time a user signs in through the ProviderSignInController.  
It also might not be a bad idea to store creation and last synced dates inside the ConnectionData object.
