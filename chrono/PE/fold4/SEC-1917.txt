DefaultAuthenticationEventPublisher is never used when an AccountStatusException is thrown
The ProviderManager created by http namespace coded in 
org.springframework.security.config.http.HttpSecurityBeanDefinitionParser#createAuthenticationManager does not register a DefaultAuthenticationEventPublisher to the bean registration. This, in combination with the AccountStatusException handling in org.springframework.security.authentication.ProviderManager#authenticate where the exception is always rethrown, renders the DefaultAuthenticationEventPublisher of the parent ProviderManager invisible.
If you consider also that the org.springframework.security.core.AuthenticationException#getAuthentication has been deprecated, I cannot find a way to retrieve the cause and the identity of the failed authentication.
