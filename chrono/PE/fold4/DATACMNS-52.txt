Declaring an intermediate base repository does not work correctly
I have cases where I want to group together several query methods, but they don&amp;apos;t seem to fit on any entity-typed repository. I realize I could just use an arbitrary entity for the repository type, but it seems architecturally wrong, and I don&amp;apos;t want to leave an option for client code to call methods inherited from GenericDao.
Therefore I suggest adding an option to create a repository that has no type and does not inherit any methods. I think the best way to configure such a repository interface is with annotations/XML, and not require inheriting from a marker interface. Such repository mechanism would not require the ability to add custom implementation, since it just groups together JPQL queries instead of placing them at the entity sources, and any "custom implementation" should be placed in other beans.
