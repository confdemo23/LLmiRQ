Incorrect changes to POM when repeating "persistence setup" command on a DataNucleus project
Run this script:






project --topLevelPackage com.example.anything




persistence setup --database HYPERSONIC_IN_MEMORY --provider DATANUCLEUS






Every time the "persistence setup --database HYPERSONIC_IN_MEMORY --provider DATANUCLEUS" command is reissued, the shell reports different POM elements (e.g. dependencies and plugins) as having been removed (alternating between those for DataNucleus and DataNucleus2).
