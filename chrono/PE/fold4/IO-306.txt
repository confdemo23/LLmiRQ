ReaderInputStream#read(byte[] b, int off, int len) should always return 0 for length == 0
The method read(byte[] b, int off, int len) should always return 0 if the requested length == 0, even if the stream is empty or at EOF, as that is how the overridden java.io.InputStream method is documented to behave.
