Using a "Not" Keyword in a Query Method Doesn&apos;t Work
I basically created an interface that contains a query method that looks something like this:






List&lt;Status&gt; findByStatusNot(String status);






When I tired to use this method spring-mongo threw: 






InvalidMongoDbApiUsageException: "Invalid query: &amp;apos;not&amp;apos; can&amp;apos;t be used with &amp;apos;is&amp;apos; - use &amp;apos;ne&amp;apos; instead."






From the looks of it there seems to be a bug in the MongoQueryCreator class which does the following for NEGATING_SIMPLE_PROPERTY case:






criteria.not().is(parameters.nextConverted(property));






Note that criteria.is() explicitly throws an exception if a call to not() proceeds it.
