RateLimitExceededException not thrown when user hit&apos;s their daily status update limit. 
I&amp;apos;ve discovered TwitterErrorHandler does not handle when the user has exceeded their daily status update limit (or part thereof) as determined by Twitter. Whenever a HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN status code is returned; duplicate status; status too long; and invalid recipient are checked before throwing a general OperationNotPermittedException. However the text "User is over daily status update limit" is not checked which should result in a RateLimitExceeded exception being thrown. 
Adding this exception would make it consistent with the spring-social-facebook.
