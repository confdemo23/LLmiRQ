ClassCastException when loading Map<String, String[]>
When saving a regular Java Map with array inside (as in SolrQuery), it seems that Spring Sata saves the object fine, but when you trying to read it, it is a Map with List as the value type. When you&amp;apos;re trying to work with the object you&amp;apos;re getting a ClassCastException: java.util.ArrayList cannot be cast to [Ljava.lang.String. We find that the problem is in MappingMongoConverter#readCollectionOrArray(), at this line:






collectionType = Collection.class.isAssignableFrom(collectionType) ? collectionType : List.class;






When the type is array (String[]) it obviously cannot be assigned to Collection so it returns it as a List. Possible solution is to return an object from this method and handle arrays too. There is a main that reproduce that issue as an attachment.
