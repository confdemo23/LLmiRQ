DBRef can accidentally get added as PersistentProperty
MappingMongoConverter.createDBRef() inspects the given object&amp;apos;s metadata to extract id value and collection information of it. In case the given object is a DBRef already this is not necessary. Actually it will cause DBRef being added as PersistentEntity which should be avoided.
