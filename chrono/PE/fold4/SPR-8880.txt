Default @ComponentScan&apos;s exclude filter to exclude @Configuration annotated classes
Suppose you have an application with a base package of com.acme with an @Configuration class located in this package. Now suppose you use this configuration class as basePackageClass inside @ComponentScan. This will result in an exception saying the class is registered twice. So you pretty much end up with always adding this exclude.
Would it make sense to default the excludeFilters attribute of the @ComponentScan annotation as follows?






@Filter(type = FilterType.ANNOTATION, value = Configuration.class)
