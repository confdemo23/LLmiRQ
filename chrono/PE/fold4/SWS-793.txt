Extending SoapFaultAnnotationExceptionResolver results in competing annotation resolvers with backwards order
I extended SoapFaultAnnotationExceptionResolver to create a custom exception resolver.  While testing I realized that the default SoapFaultAnnotationExceptionResolver was handling the annotated exception being thrown.  From the logs I could see that both resolvers were being created, and the custom one was never called.
I reverted back to version 2.0.1_RELEASE and the problem went away.  It also appeared like the default SoapFaultAnnotationExceptionResolver was not created.
One workaround for this is to set the order of the custom resolver to highest priority, therefore delegating the exceptions to that resolver first, but this is not consistent with the documentation and samples.
