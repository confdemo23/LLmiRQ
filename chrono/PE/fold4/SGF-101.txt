The repository deleteall() method only works for replicated regions
The repository deleteAll() method calls the gemfire region clear() method which is unsupported for partitioned regions.  As there does not yet exist a removeAll() in GemFire, the proper implementation should be to individually delete all entries in the region specified by the repository.
