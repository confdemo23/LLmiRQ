Job execution marked as STOPPED when exception occurs while committing StepExecution
When an exception occurs while committing StepExecution (in org.springframework.batch.core.step.tasklet.TaskletStep.ChunkTransactionCallback#doInTransaction()) setTerminateOnly is being called on the step execution. This results in the job execution being marked as STOPPED. I think it&amp;apos;s better to mark the job execution as FAILED? The STOPPED status in general indicates the job has been stopped in a controlled way (via spring-batch gui, programmatically via the JobOperator API, ...).
