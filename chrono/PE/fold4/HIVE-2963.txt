metastore delegation token is not getting used by hive commandline
When metastore delegation tokens are used to run hive (or hcat) commands, the delegation token does not end up getting used.
This is because new Hive object is not created with value of hive.metastore.token.signature in its conf. This config parameter is missing in the list of HiveConf variables whose change results in metastore recreation.
