OAuth2AuthenticationDetails is not Serializable
Since Authentication is Serializable, all sub-components of it must also be Serializable. An OAuth2Authentication object may now be augmented with an OAuth2AuthenticationDetails object, but as this class is not Serializable any attempts to read or write the object with the Serialization API will fail.
