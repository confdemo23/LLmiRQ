Problems With FlatFileItemWriter: error while trying to restart an execution 
We are having problems with property "shouldDeleteIfEmpty" from FlatFileItemWriter.
If an error occurs during an execution, we are unable to restart application because the re-execution cannot find the files created at first time. For example:
Application functionality:
We have an application which receive an input file "INPUT.TXT". The invalid data from input file gets a "rejected" status and are recorded in a file named "INPUT.TXT.REJ". The valid data are processed and generate an output file "OUTPUT.TXT".
Both files, output and rejected, are generated by FlatFileItemWriter, and they have property "shouldDeleteIfEmpty" with value=true.
Error scenario:
If we didn&amp;apos;t give reading permission and execute the application, it will not be able to read INPUT.TXT file. So an exception is thrown. Then we give reading permission, and try to re-execute the application. Another Exception is thrown because the application cannot read the output file or the rejected file that were created at first execution. The files were deleted because when the error occurred both files were empty.
Because of these problems we can&amp;apos;t execute reprocessing. I believe the re-execution should be able to create a new file if it doesn&amp;apos;t exists.
