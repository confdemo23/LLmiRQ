using @Query annotation, arrays are translated somewhere between query creation and mongo interpretation
I&amp;apos;m trying to pass an array for a $all query so that I can keep all my queries in the same repository interface.  I&amp;apos;ve tried various things, but I keep getting 






org.springframework.data.mongodb.UncategorizedMongoDbException: $all requires array; 




nested exception is com.mongodb.MongoException: $all requires array






Putting debug on both ends, Spring Data is logging:






DEBUG [10/04/2012 09:57:38 BST - main] - Created query { "tags" : { "$all" : [ "green" , "orange"]}}




DEBUG [10/04/2012 09:57:38 BST - main] - find using query: { "tags" : { "$all" : [ "green" , "orange"]}} fields: null for class:






and that query when pasted into a mongo shell is correct, returning the required documents however mongo is logging:






Tue Apr 10 10:57:39 [conn84] assertion 13050 $all requires array ns:database.collection query:{ tags: { $all: { 0: "green", 1: "orange" } } }






Which when pasted into a mongo shell returns the above error.
Debugging, this translation error occurs in DBObject org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.QueryMapper.getMappedObject(DBObject query, MongoPersistentEntity&lt;?&gt; entity)
It looks like this needs another clause for $all, similar to that which exists for $.*or.
