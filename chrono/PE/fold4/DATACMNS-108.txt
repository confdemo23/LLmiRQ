RepositoryFactorySupport throws ClassCastException for annotation based repositories
Repository interfaces using the annotation based declaration model cannot be created through RepositoryFactorySupport as it&amp;apos;s generics are typed to T extends Repository. As the proxy generated might not implement this interface itself we should add it to the interfaces the proxy exposes.
