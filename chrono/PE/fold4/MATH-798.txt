PolynomialFitter.fit() stalls
Hi, in certain cases I ran into the problem that the PolynomialFitter.fit() method stalls, meaning that it does not return, nor throw an Exception (even if it runs for 90 min). Is there a way to tell the PolynomialFitter to iterate only N-times to ensure that my program does not stall?
