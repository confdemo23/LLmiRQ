Errors when using AbstractIdentifiableAnnotatedJavaStructureBuilder.updateTypeAnnotation
There are a couple of problems with AbstractIdentifiableAnnotatedJavaStructureBuilder.updateTypeAnnotation:

NPE when attempting to update an annotation that is currently not present
Passing in null for attributesToDeleteIfPresent causes new attributes not to be added

It would also be nice to add a few convenience methods to skip passing in null for attributesToDeleteIfPresent and the ability to accept AnnotationMetadataBuilders.
