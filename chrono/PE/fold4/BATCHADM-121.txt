/jobs/executions/{jobExecutionId}/steps.json returns the HTML page instead of JSON
Both /jobs/executions/
{jobExecutionId}/steps and /jobs/executions/{jobExecutionId}
/steps.json return the same HTML page. The .json page should return JSON.
How about writing an end-to-end test which checks that all the .json pages listed in Home return JSON?
