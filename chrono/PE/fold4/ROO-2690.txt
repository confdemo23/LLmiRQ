Same POM dependency can be added twice with different versions 
One way to replicate this bug is as follows:

In Roo 1.1.5, run the clinic.roo script
Roo emits this output (in part):






Updated ROOT/pom.xml [added dependencies org.hibernate:hibernate-core:3.6.4.Final, org.hibernate:hibernate-entitymanager:3.6.4.Final, org.hibernate.javax.persistence:hibernate-jpa-2.0-api:1.0.0.Final]






Quit Roo 1.1.5 and run the latest snapshot build
Rerun the persistence command used by clinic.roo, i.e. persistence setup --provider HIBERNATE --database HYPERSONIC_IN_MEMORY
Roo emits this output:






Updated ROOT/pom.xml [added dependencies org.hibernate:hibernate-core:3.6.7.Final, org.hibernate:hibernate-entitymanager:3.6.7.Final, org.hibernate.javax.persistence:hibernate-jpa-2.0-api:1.0.1.Final]






... and sure enough, each of the following artifacts appears twice in the POM, with different version numbers as shown:


org.hibernate:hibernate-core: 3.6.4.Final and 3.6.7.Final
org.hibernate:hibernate-entitymanager: 3.6.4.Final and 3.6.7.Final
org.hibernate.javax.persistence:hibernate-jpa-2.0-api: 1.0.0.Final and 1.0.1.Final

Obviously it&amp;apos;s bad practice to have the same dependency twice with different versions. Maven will actually use the first occurrence of each dependency in the POM, so in the above case at least, Maven will quietly ignore the newer versions of those artifacts.
The bug is due to the fact that:

o.s.r.project.ProjectOperations.addDependencies(List&lt;Dependency&gt;) uses the Dependency#equals method (via Set#contains) to check for the existence of a given dependency, and
Dependency#equals checks the dependency&amp;apos;s version field (i.e. two versions of the same artifact are not "equal")
