Previous attributes not being cleared in TypeLocationService on re-caching type
Stale items such as annotations that are no longer applied to a type were never being cleared in TypeLocationService. This can lead to NPE when TypeLocationService indicates that an annotation exists and then it is not found by subsequent logic.
