DataConfiguration.get() cannot handle a trivial conversion
A call to DataConfiguration.get() eventually invokes the PropertyConverter.to() method. Here a number of supported data types are checked and corresponding conversions are done.
However, the case that the value does not need to be converted at all - because it already has the expected type - is not taken into account. This is especially a problem for string values: there is not conversion to string, so the get() method fails even if the value is already a string.
