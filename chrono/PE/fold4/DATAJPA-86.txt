find-Method throws exception when a group-by-clause is used
When using a repository to get a Page object with this method Page&lt;T&gt; findAll(Specification&lt;T&gt; specification, Pageable pageable) two queries are generated. A count-Query to get the total number of results and the actual query to get the results for the page. When the specification-parameter contains a group by-clause the count-query throws an exception org.springframework.dao.IncorrectResultSizeDataAccessException result returns more than one elements). The problem is that the group by-clause returns more than one result row for the count query and only a single result with one number is expected.
Example:






SELECT DISTINCT COUNT(id) FROM Table WHERE value &gt; 70 GROUP BY name;






Result:
4 (for name1)
7 (for name2)
2 (for name3)
So if there&amp;apos;s more than one result being returned from the count query we actually have to consider the size of the list instead of the value returned.
