Too relaxed tar detection in ArchiveStreamFactory
The relaxed tar detection logic added in COMPRESS-117 unfortunately matches also some non-tar files like a test AIFF file that Apache Tika uses. It would be good to improve the detection heuristics to still match files like the one in COMPRESS-117 but avoid false positives like the AIFF file in Tika.
