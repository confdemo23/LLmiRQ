MethodEndpoint.getBean is inconsistent with its API
The API description of MethodEndpoint.getBean says "Returns the object bean for this method endpoint." But if the constructor with a BeanFactory argument is used, it actually returns the bean name (String) instead of the actual bean! 
You might correct the documentation, but I&amp;apos;d much prefer if you fix the implementation to do as the documentation says, since currently you need to get hold of the BeanFactory as well to get to the endpoint object, and the MethodEndpoint does not provide it.
