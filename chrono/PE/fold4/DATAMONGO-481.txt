After upgrading to 1.0.2 IsTrue does not work properly in query method
For such created query:
Account findByUsernameAndConfirmedIsTrue(String username);
I see following in logs:
Created query Query: { "confirmed" : true , "$and" : [ 
{ "confirmed" : true}
]}, Fields: null, Sort: null
And the query does not return proper value.
In previous release (1.0.1.RELEASE) the same code produces valid query:
Created query 
{ "username" : "me" , "confirmed" : true}
