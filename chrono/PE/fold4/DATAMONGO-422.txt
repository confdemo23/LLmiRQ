UUIDToBinaryConverter not compatible with mongo java driver
UUID to Binary conversion as implemented in spring-data-mongodb converts the UUID to a string and saves it as a mongo Binary with subtype BSON.B_UUID:






return source == null ? null : new Binary(BSON.B_UUID, source.toString().getBytes("UTF-8"));






The java driver reads this value back in with






org.bson.BasicBSONDecoder






case B_UUID:




    if ( totalLen != 16 )




        throw new IllegalArgumentException( "bad data size subtype 3 len: " + totalLen + " != 16");









    long part1 = _in.readLong();




    long part2 = _in.readLong();




    _callback.gotUUID(name, part1, part2);




    return;




}






That obviously does not work because the java driver expects to read in 2 x 8 bytes containing the most and least significant bytes when it encounters the binary subtype BSON.B_UUID. The converter has to save UUIDs as in BasicBSONEncoder (method putUUID, arround line 266 in 2.7.1) in order for this to work.
