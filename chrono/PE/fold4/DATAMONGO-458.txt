When reading back empty collections unmodifiable instances of Collections.emptyList/Set is returned.
When reading back a document stored with an empty collection, e.g:
  private Set&lt;ClusterId&gt; clusters = new HashSet&lt;ClusterId&gt;();
The driver deserializes this into a instance of Collections.emptySet, thus causing UnsupportedOperation exception when modifying.
