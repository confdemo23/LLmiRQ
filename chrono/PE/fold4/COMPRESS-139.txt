ZipFile fails to clean up Inflater resources
This bug has been reported to Ant&amp;apos;s original code as https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=42696 .  It seems as if InflaterInputStream.close() didn&amp;apos;t clean up the Inflater instance if one is passed in to the constructor.  I&amp;apos;m currently testing the patch to Ant and will merge it over once I&amp;apos;m ready.
The code in Harmony[1] does invoke inflater.end but calling it again won&amp;apos;t hurt.  OpenJDK&amp;apos;s InflaterInputStream[2] in fact behaves as described in Mounir&amp;apos;s comment to Ant&amp;apos;s Bugzilla.
