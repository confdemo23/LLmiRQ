Fields marked with --sizeMin don&apos;t always have "required" in prompt  
To replicate:

Run clinic.roo
Go to the "Create new Owner" page
Click into the "Email" field; note that the prompt says "Enter Email"
Submit the form; the email field displays the error "size must be between 6 and 30"

If the form won&amp;apos;t submit without an email addresses entered, then the prompt for that field should say "Enter Email (required)".
The workaround is to add a JPA @NotNull annotation to the relevant entity field; the MVC addon will then update the relevant JSPX files by adding required="true" to that field. However @NotNull is a persistence-related annotation, not a validation/UI annotation. The presence of the JSR-303 @SizeMin annotation should be enough for the MVC addon to mark the field as required.
