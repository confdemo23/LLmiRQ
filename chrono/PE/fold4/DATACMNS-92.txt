Invalid Entities are placed in the MappingContext - Cache
If a call to verify() of an persistent entity fails, it is still in the cache and will be returned on the next call of getPersistentEntity(), so you get the exception thrown by verify() on the first call and get just the entity back on the second call. So we need to remove the entity from the cache after a failed verify(), or put a Null/Dummy object in there that throws the same mapping exeption on getPersistentEntity().
