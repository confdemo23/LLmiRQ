BeiderMorseEncoder OOM issues
In Lucene/Solr, we integrated this encoder into the latest release.
Our tests use a variety of random strings, and we have recent jenkins failures
from some input streams (of length &lt;= 10), using huge amounts of memory (e.g. &gt; 64MB),
resulting in OOM.
I&amp;apos;ve created a test case (length is 30 here) that will OOM with -Xmx256M. 
I haven&amp;apos;t dug into this much as to what&amp;apos;s causing it, but I suspect there might be a bug
revolving around certain punctuation characters: we didn&amp;apos;t see this happening until
we beefed up our random string generation to start producing "html-like" strings.
