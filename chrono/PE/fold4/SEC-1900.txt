sec:authorize ifAllGranted does not work if Authorities are deprecated GrantedAuthorityImpl
&lt;sec:authorize ifAllGranted="ROLE_ADMIN"&gt;
did not work for me after upgrading to 3.1.0 
reason: i added some role manually in my own UserDetails like this:
  GrantedAuthority granted = new GrantedAuthorityImpl(rolle.toString());
  authorities.add(granted);
GrantedAuthorityImpl is deprecated and ifAllGranted, too. But i think it is still a bug.
You can fix it by using simpleGrantedAuthority
GrantedAuthority granted = new SimpleGrantedAuthority(rolle.toString());
authorities.add(granted);
the bug is somewhere in the Collection class in an equals method. It checks if the containing element is of class SimpleGrantedAuthority.
