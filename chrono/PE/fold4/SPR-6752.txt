RestTemplate throws IllegalArgumentException when HTTP status is not in the HttpStatus enum 
Using RestTemplate to connect to a server that occasionally throws HTTP Status of 420, I am getting IllegalArgumentExceptions when accessing the HttpStatus object in my implementation of the ResponseErrorHandler interface.  When I removed that, and started pulling the status from the Headers directly, RestTemplate started throwing errors due to the logger.warn call in RestTemplate.handleResponseError().  I&amp;apos;ve gotten around this by not using the HttpStatus enum (getting status from the HttpHeaders directly) and by turning up the log level for RestTemplate to ERROR.  Shouldn&amp;apos;t this support any HTTP status value?
