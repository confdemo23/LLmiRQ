Distinguishing write errors and writes with zero documents affected
Currently MongoTemplate.handleAnyWriteResultErrors(...) have the same behavior for write errors and zero writes (conditional updates with zero documents affected) which is not always convenient because there are cases when zero write is not an error.
Examples:

Optimistic lock for update http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Atomic+Operations#AtomicOperations-%22UpdateifCurrent%22
Updating something in concurrent environment.

Sometimes best solution is to silently ignore updating or deleting of missed document but still throw in case of DB errors.
