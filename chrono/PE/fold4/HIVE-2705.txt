SemanticAnalyzer twice swallows an exception it shouldn&apos;t
Twice SemanticAnalyzer catches an exception and drops it, just passing on the original message&amp;apos;s in a new SemanticException. This means that those that see the message in the output cannot tell what generated the original exception.  These original exceptions should be wrapped, as they are in other parts of the code.
