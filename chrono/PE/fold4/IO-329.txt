FileUtils.writeLines uses unbuffered IO
FileUtils.writeLines looks like next:
 out = openOutputStream(file, append);
 IOUtils.writeLines(lines, lineEnding, out, encoding);
openOutputStream opens plain FileOutputStream without any buffering and IOUtils.writeLines does not add abyt buffering. This means each line require 2 write syscalls (one for the line and one for line separator). This makes call very slow, especially for short lines
