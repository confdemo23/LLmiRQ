A file change detected by Roo&apos;s polling mechanism does not update the changed file set
Only changes made via Roo through the MutableFile infrastructure are being reflected in the file change set, i.e. what is returned via getWhatsDirty. This is really bad as it causes a stale type cache when a user updates a type.
