Using Update.set in nested arrays does not save the _class attribute
I have a service method like that:






	public Goal save(Goal goal) {




		Match match = this.mongoTemplate.findAndModify(




				query(where("goals").elemMatch(where("id").is(goal.getId()))),




				new Update().set("goals.$", goal), Match.class);




		return match.findGoalById(goal.getId());




	}






classes:






class Match {




     List&lt;Goal&gt; goals;




}




class Goal {




     Player player;




}




abstract class Player {}




class Forward extends Player {}




class Defender extends Player{}






When running the method above, the _class information for the Player object in the Goal class does not get saved in the database. This makes the saved document unloadable by Spring MongoDB.
Doing like that however will work:






Goal g = match.getGoal(&lt;id&gt;);




g.setPlayer(&lt;a player&gt;);






matchRepository.save(match);
