POJO containing a List of Maps not persisting properly
I&amp;apos;m trying to represent a JSON structure that looks like this:






{"id": "abc123", "listOfMaps" : [ { "aString" : "aValue" , "anArray" : { "anotherValue"}}]}






But when I create a POJO and matching Repository to persist it, the Map containing a List of Strings does not persist properly. I&amp;apos;ve attached a screenshot from my debugger to show what it looks like in memory. When converted to a String using a MongoTemplate, it looks like:






{ "_class" : "com.foo.MyPojo" , "_id" : { "$oid" : "4eaec52bad108fb6c5ecde5a"} , "listOfMaps" : [ { "aString" : "aValue" , "anArray" : { "_class" : "[[Ljava.lang.String;"}}]}






Note that I&amp;apos;m losing the values in "anArray".
This is using 1.0.0M5. I&amp;apos;ve included a full unit test. Should just need to set appropriate MongoDB server settings in the Spring config file to get it running.
