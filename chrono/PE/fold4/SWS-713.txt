Order of interceptor calls is dependent on the way the interceptors are included
The InterceptorsBeanDefinitionParser scans for interceptors in the following order: first "bean", then "ref", and so on. I.e. the order in which the interceptors are called is dependent on the way the interceptors are included.
One would expect that the interceptors are called in the order in which they were specified, so that changing a "bean" to a "ref" does not modify the calling order.
