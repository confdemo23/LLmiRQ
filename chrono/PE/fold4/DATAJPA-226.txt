Misleading Exception when @Query is not valid
Repository Function:






@Query("select distict(foo.bar) from Foo foo) List&lt;Bar&gt; getBar();






distict is intentional wrong, this will cause the problem. When the Repository is being created the following Exception occurs:






Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No property get found for type class Foo






It seems that after the validation of the Query results in a failure the query generation by method name is triggered.
