"java.io.EOFException: Truncated ZIP entry: <some entry>"- while extracting a zip file that contains a entry which lager than 2 GB (Integer#MAX_VALUE)
Issue:
"java.io.EOFException: Truncated ZIP entry: &lt;some entry&gt;" will be threw while extracting a zip file that contains a entry with size larger than Integer#MAX_VALUE bytes (about 2 GB). After the big entry has been read, then try to get next entry by calling ZipArchiveInputStream#getNextZipEntry(), and it throws that EOFException.
Cause:
before getting next zip entry, ZipArchiveInputStream tries to close the current entry and in the close- method it use the field "bytesReadFromStream" to ensure all entry bytes are read, however the field "bytesReadFromStream" is a integer, that means it is already overflowed and it leads to a false ensure result.
Solution suggestion:
instead integer using long for "bytesReadFromStream" and possibly for "readBytesOfEntry" too.
