SimpleRegression has extraneous constructor
The SimpleRegression(int) constructor added in version 2.2 has no effect on any statistics computed by the class.  The private TDistributionImpl data member that this constructor initializes is no longer meaningful, as a new distribution instance is created each time it is needed.  The T distribution implementation used in computations is no longer meaningfully pluggable, so the instance field should be removed, along with this constructor.
