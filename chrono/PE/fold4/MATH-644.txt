for the class of hyper-geometric distribution, for some number the method "upperCumulativeProbability" return a probability greater than 1 which is impossible.  
In windows 7, I used common.Math library. I used class "HypergeometricDistributionImpl" and method "upperCumulativeProbability" of zero for distribution and the return value is larget than 1. the following code is working error. 
HypergeometricDistributionImpl u = new HypergeometricDistributionImpl(14761461, 1035 ,1841 );
System.out.println(u.upperCumulativeProbability(0))
Thanks
