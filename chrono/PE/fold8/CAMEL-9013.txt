Camel HTTP no longer supporting chunked transfer encoding with Tomcat
When sending a chunked POST whilst running the servlet under Tomcat, camel now fails to read the input stream and sets the body to null.
chunked-http-failure-test
This is due to camel checking the stream for available bytes introduced in CAMEL-5806. For whatever reason the CoyoteInputStream is returning 0 available bytes when handling a chunked request.



    if (len &lt; 0) {

        InputStream is = request.getInputStream();

        if (is.available() == 0) {

            // no data so return null

            return null;

        }

    }
