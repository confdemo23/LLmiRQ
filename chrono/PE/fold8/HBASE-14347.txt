Add a switch to DynamicClassLoader to disable it
Since HBASE-1936 we have the option to load jars dynamically by default from HDFS or the local filesystem, however hbase.dynamic.jars.dir points to a directory that could be world writable it potentially opens a security problem in both the client side and the RS. We should consider to have a switch to enable or disable this option and it should be off by default.
