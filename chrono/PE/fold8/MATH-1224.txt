NullPointerExceptions not documented in some classes
In general, the need to initialize newly constructed objects with more data is now documented, but we have found two cases where a NullPointerException is thrown because of missing data.
The documentation should be updated to reflect this. This is similar to issues report in MATH-1116 but concerns classes that are not going to be deprecated (as far as we can tell).
I have previously posted this as a new comment on issue 1116, but that comment has not elicited any response. As the original issue is one year old, I post this bug as a new issue.
Below is the code that produces the two cases:
org.apache.commons.math3.ode.nonstiff.HighamHall54Integrator var1 = new org.apache.commons.math3.ode.nonstiff.HighamHall54Integrator(0.0d, 0.0d, 0.0d, 0.0d);
double[] var2 = new double[] 
{ 0.0d }
;
var1.computeDerivatives(0.0d, var2, var2); // NPE
new org.apache.commons.math3.stat.correlation.SpearmansCorrelation().getCorrelationMatrix(); // NPE
