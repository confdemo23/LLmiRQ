PUT/PATCH does not consider custom Jackson field naming strategy
1. git clone https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-accessing-data-rest.git
2. use spring.jackson.property-naming-strategy=PASCAL_CASE_TO_CAMEL_CASE
3. PUT/PATCH fails.
org.springframework.data.rest.webmvc.json.DomainObjectReader:170 will remove valid property names required by the objectMapper later on. 
If one posts camelCase properties instead, the objectMapper will ignore them.
Possible fix is to simply not remove properties so eagerly (Line 170) and let the objectMapper decide.
