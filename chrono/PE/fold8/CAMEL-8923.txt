Kafka: Topic name lookup from message headers in the producer causes infinite loop
Refer changes done for CAMEL-7331
The change causes a critical bug.
For a camel route as follows:



from("kafka://&lt;broker&gt;?topic=T1")

.process(myProcessor)

.to("kafka://&lt;broker&gt;?topic=T2")



KafkaExchange will be created by KafkaConsumer and the topic will be set to "T1" in the header.
For the &amp;apos;to&amp;apos; endpoint, KafkaProducer will try to read the topic from the exchange header which is still "T1" instead of "T2" thereby causing an infinite loop.
As discussed in user-group, a different header should be used to read the topic name from message.
