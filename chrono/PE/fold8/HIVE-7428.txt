OrcSplit fails to account for columnar projections in its size estimates
Currently, ORC generates splits based on stripe offset + stripe length.
This means that the splits for all columnar projections are exactly the same size, despite reading the footer which gives the estimated sizes for each column.
This is a hold-out from FileSplit which uses getLen() as the I/O cost of reading a file in a map-task.
RCFile didn&amp;apos;t have a footer with column statistics information, but for ORC this would be extremely useful to reduce task overheads when processing extremely wide tables with highly selective column projections.
