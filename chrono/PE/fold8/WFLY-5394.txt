Generic acceptor/connector is ignoring its socket-binding
If netty acceptor is configured then port is not opened:






&lt;acceptor name="netty" factory-class="org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.remoting.impl.netty.NettyAcceptorFactory" socket-binding="messaging"/&gt;






after server is started. Setting higher priority because it&amp;apos;s core functionality.
