NullPointerExceptions when issuing PATCH requests on entities containing Map properties
The PATCH request when we have a Map in our entities doesn&amp;apos;t work. I have a map containing the localizations values for an field.  The PUT/POST works correctly. Once I try to PATCH with application/json media type I get a NullPointerException.
Just send the following raw content as PATCH request body:






{




  "name": {




    "bg_BG": {




      "value": "123"




    },




    "en_GB": {




      "value": "Mens66"




    }




  }




}






The problem I guess is inside DomainObjectReader.doMerge(). Here once I hit the map property there is a check is nested != null and is it a property. Because property is true it invokes recursively the doMerge() method which at the beginning is trying to get entities.getPersistentEntity() but the argument passed is a PersistentMap and the result is null, so after that getJacksonProperties() of null throws an NPE. 
I am attaching a simple project containing a JUnit test that shows that (the test is called testPatchHttp).
Looking at the code I noticed that in JsonPatchHandler.apply() there is a check checking request.isJsonPatchRequest() which in case of application/json is false. (the case explained above) I tried to send content type of application/json-patch+json to go on the other route but there I also got an exception "Can not deserialize instance of java.util.ArrayList out of START_OBJECT token". I am attaching this test as well which is called "testPatchJsonPatchHttp".
