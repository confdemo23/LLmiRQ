ForeignException should not be sent to the client
ForeignException is in hbase-server so the client will not be able to deserialize it, and also it will hide the DoNotRetryException of the cause.
I haven&amp;apos;t found an easy way to test it, aside manually looking at the logs. and this stuff will go away with proc-v2. so for now the easy workaround is catch the ForeignException in the master which are just the few places related to proc-v1 and throw the cause to the client
