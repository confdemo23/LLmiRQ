Potential NullPointerException in AbstractMappingContext
We found the reported issue upgrading Spring Data MongoDB library from 1.3.5.RELEASE to 1.5.5.RELEASE. The issue is triggered querying a nested generic field qualified with a custom class (not primitive). Following snippet shows the nested field we are trying to query:






public class External{




 ..




 private Optional&lt;Internal&gt; field = new Optional&lt;Internal&gt;();




 ..




}






The call to mongoOperations throws a NullPointerException originating from AbstractMappingContext. It is a Spring Data Commons class and we noticed that the issue starts from version 1.7.2.RELEASE of this library, just after commit 02046da.
