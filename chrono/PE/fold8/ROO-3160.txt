entity fields and ITD&apos;s methods javadoc 
It would be great feature If there will be possibility to set javadoc text for ITDs methods and fields.
For complex methods created in Metadata classes (for example org.springframework.roo.addon.jsf.managedbean.JsfManagedBeanMetadata)
it is very important to attach some javadoc commets for them.
I suggest simply way to add method for 
org.springframework.roo.classpath.details.MethodMetadataBuilder
named like "setJavadoc".
