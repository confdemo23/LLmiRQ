Comparison bug in HiveSplitGenerator.InputSplitComparator#compare()
"compare()" method in HiveSplitGenerator.InputSplitComparator has the following condition on line 281 which is always false and is most likely a typo:



if (startPos1 &gt; startPos1) {



As a result, in certain conditions splits might be sorted in incorrect order.
