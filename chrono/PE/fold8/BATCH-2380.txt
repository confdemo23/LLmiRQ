DelimitedLineTokenizer allows null and empty string as delimiters
In doTokenize, there are several delimiter.length() calls which will cause a NullPointerException if the delimiter is null.
If empty string is passed in as a delimiter, then this degenerates to an identity mapping and this would not be useful.
Either of these situations can happen if the delimiter gets set dynamically at runtime.
