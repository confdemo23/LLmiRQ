MethodInvokingTaskletAdaper does not support primitive arguments
The argument check in MethodInvokingTaskletAdapter fails for primitive paramters. Eg: I have a method that takes a single double primitive parameter. When I set the arguments property on the bean it takes an Object[] so it will be a Double object that is passed here. This causes an error when Spring creates the bean as it checks the types of arguments against the type of parameters, but double is not assignable from Double. If I extend the class and override afterPropertiesSet to remove the check it all works as expected.
