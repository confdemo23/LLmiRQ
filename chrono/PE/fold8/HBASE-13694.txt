CallQueueSize is incorrectly decremented until the response is sent
We should decrement the CallQueueSize as soon as we no longer need the call around, e.g. after RpcServer.CurCall.set(null) otherwise we will be only pushing back other client requests while we send the response back to the client that originated the call.
