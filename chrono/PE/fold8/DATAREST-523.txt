Unable to augment collection association using POST
It seems that POSTing an item to an associated collection does not work as documented.
According to the Spring Data REST documentation, POST method is supported for collections, so 






curl -i -X POST -H &amp;apos;Content-type: text/uri-list&amp;apos; -d &amp;apos;http://localhost:8080/artifacts/1&amp;apos; http://localhost:8080/collectors/1/artifacts






should add an artifact to the (yet empty) collection. Unfortunately, it does not:






    HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed




    Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1




    Allow: GET, DELETE, PATCH, PUT




    Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8




    Transfer-Encoding: chunked

My entities:






    @Data




    @Entity




    public class Collector {




        @Id




        @GeneratedValue




        private Long id;




    




        private String name;




    




        @OneToMany(mappedBy = "owner")




        private List&lt;Artifact&gt; artifacts;




    }




    




    @Data




    @Entity




    @Accessors(chain = true, fluent = true)




    public class Artifact {




    




        @Id




        @GeneratedValue




        private Long id;




    




        private String title;




    




        @ManyToOne




        @JoinColumn(name = "collector_id")




        private Collector owner;




    }
