New entity merged rather than persisted when ID is not generated and version is in a MappedSuperClass 
Effect of bug is that SimpleJpaRepository::save(...) uses em.merge on a brand new entity, causing both  @PostPersist and @PostUpdate callbacks to be invoked.
Requirements to hit the bug:

An Entity class that has a provided identity (i.e. no id generation), so the ID field is non-null at the very start.







public class User extends AbstractEntity {




  @Id()




  @Column(nullable = false, length = 64, unique = true)




  private String phone;




  ...




}







A MappedSuperclass that contains the version field:






@MappedSuperclass




public abstract class AbstractEntity implements Serializable {









  @Version




  private Long version;




  ...




}







=&gt; With this, we will get two callbacks.
=&gt; Moving the version field from the abstract class to every concrete class causes the expected behaviour to occur.
