Wrong statistics for subroutes
Some statistics seem to be wrong for subroutes.
MetricsStatistics.onExchangeDone method is called several times for a same exchange: first by the subroute and then by its parent route.
The problem is that context.stop() is called several times so counters is greater than 1 for the subroute instead of one.
A solution could be to reset the context into the exchange as soon as the stop method has been called:
MetricsRoutePolicy.java


private static final class MetricsStatistics {

        private final Timer responses;



        private MetricsStatistics(Timer responses) {

            this.responses = responses;

        }



        public void onExchangeBegin(Exchange exchange) {

            Timer.Context context = responses.time();

            exchange.setProperty("MetricsRoutePolicy", context);

        }



        public void onExchangeDone(Exchange exchange) {

            Timer.Context context = exchange.getProperty("MetricsRoutePolicy", Timer.Context.class);

            if (context != null) {

                context.stop();

                // BUGFIX: reset to null so that context.stop() cannot be called

                // more than once.

                exchange.setProperty("MetricsRoutePolicy", null);



            }

        }

    }
