Admin in Monitor role can execute test-connection-in-pool op
This should not work, as the Monitor role is not allowed to do anything that modifies any state:






[standalone@localhost:9990 data-source=ExampleDS] :test-connection-in-pool{roles=Monitor}




{




    "outcome" =&gt; "success",




    "result" =&gt; [true]




}






I believe the problem is PoolOperations L75:






final ServiceController&lt;?&gt; managementRepoService = context.getServiceRegistry(false).getService(




        ConnectorServices.MANAGEMENT_REPOSITORY_SERVICE);






The parameter to context.getServiceRegistry(...) must be &amp;apos;true&amp;apos; if the operation is going to use the returned service registry to perform any form of state modification. So I believe all the PoolOperation subclasses should provide a param to PoolOperation&amp;apos;s constructor that can be used to set this value. I believe in all subclasses except DumpQueuedThreadInPool this param should be &amp;apos;true&amp;apos;.
