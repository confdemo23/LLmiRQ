Failed MiniZooKeeperCluster startup did not shutdown ZK servers
MiniZooKeeperCluster#startup() starts servers one-by-one, if everything is good, it would declare success of start:



  public int startup(File baseDir, int numZooKeeperServers) 

    ...

    // running all the ZK servers

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; numZooKeeperServers; i++) {

    ...===&gt; could throw exception in the loop and end the startup

      // Start up this ZK server

      standaloneServerFactory.startup(server);

      ...

      standaloneServerFactoryList.add(standaloneServerFactory);

      zooKeeperServers.add(server);

    }

   ...

    started = true;

    ...

  }





However, if exception throws in the middle of start up (eg. some servers already started), the MiniZooKeeperCluster#shutdown() would not shut down them and clean up resources.  



  public void shutdown() throws IOException {

    if (!started) {

      return;

    }

    ...

  }
