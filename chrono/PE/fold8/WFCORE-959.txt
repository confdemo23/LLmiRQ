Handling of ManagementResourceRegistration runtimeOnly is broken
NodeSubregistry is always passing &amp;apos;false&amp;apos; as the runtimeOnly param for ConcreteResourceRegistrations it creates.
The param isn&amp;apos;t actually needed, since the ResourceDefinition is also a param, and the value can be pulled from it.
Also, since we now have proper facilities for setting up a runtimeOnly ResourceDefinition, the MRR.setRuntimeOnly() method should be deprecated and all core uses of it converted.
