count(*) with count(distinct) gives wrong results when hive.groupby.skewindata=true
When hive.groupby.skewindata=true, the following query based on TPC-H gives wrong results:



set hive.groupby.skewindata=true;



select l_returnflag, count(*), count(distinct l_linestatus)

from lineitem

group by l_returnflag

limit 10;



The query plan shows that it generates only one MapReduce job instead of two theoretically, which is dictated by hive.groupby.skewindata=true.
The problem arises only when 

count(*)

 and 

count(distinct)

 exist together.
