Splitting WALs, we are filtering out too many edits -> DATALOSS
I&amp;apos;ve been running ITBLLs against branch-1 around HBASE-13616 (move of ServerShutdownHandler to pv2). I have come across an instance of dataloss. My patch for HBASE-13616 was in place so can only think it the cause (but cannot see how). When we split the logs, we are skipping legit edits. Digging.
