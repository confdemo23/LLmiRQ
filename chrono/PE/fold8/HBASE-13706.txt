CoprocessorClassLoader should not exempt Hive classes
CoprocessorClassLoader is used to load classes from the coprocessor jar.
Certain classes are exempt from being loaded by this ClassLoader, which means they will be ignored in the coprocessor jar, but loaded from parent classpath instead.
One problem is that we categorically exempt "org.apache.hadoop".
But it happens that Hive packages start with "org.apache.hadoop".
There is no reason to exclude hive classes from theCoprocessorClassLoader.
HBase does not even include Hive jars.
