BasicAuthenticationFilter ignores remember-me authentication
Repro:

Configure an application to use httpBasic auth and rememberMe authentication.
Notice that no remember-me cookie is set by the server, even on a successful authentication

Problem: the RememberMeServices and other related configuration set up by the rememberMe() configurer is never propagated to the BasicAuthenticationFilter&amp;apos;s setRememberMeServices method. BasicAuthenticationFilter retains it&amp;apos;s default NullRememberMeServices instance assigned at construction time, which means that all remember-me operations are a no-op.
Workaround:

Here is a gist of the changes that were necessary to propagate the remember me configuration through to the BasicAuthenticationFilter using a Spring Security ObjectPostProcessor: https://gist.github.com/cbeams/f3c36caae7046b03609a. (Note that it was also attempted to use a BeanPostProcessor, but this caused lifecycle issues due to dependence on other Spring beans.)

With this configuration in place, everything works as expected for remember-me authentication.
Documentation:

If and when this issue is fixed, i.e. BasicAuthenticationFilter begins to respect rememberMe settings, the first sentence of this section of the Spring Security documentation should be removed: http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/4.0.1.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#remember-me-impls
