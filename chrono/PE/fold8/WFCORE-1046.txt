Show error message when accessing http management console of a slave host controller
WFCORE-678 removed the selection of the ConsoleMode.SLAVE_HC console, to show the message: "You may not access the admin console on this node, all access must come via the master host controller" when you tried to access a slave host controller console.
That was the default behavior when you enabled the http management interface on a slave host controller (to access it using JON for monitoring, for example).
