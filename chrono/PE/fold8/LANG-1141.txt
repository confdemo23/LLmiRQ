StrLookup.systemPropertiesLookup() no longer reacts on changes on system properties
In versions of Commons Lang before 3.4 a Lookup object created from the systemPropertiesLookup() method offered a live view of system properties. So if a system property was changed after the creation of the lookup object, the new value was visible. In version 3.4 this is no longer the case.
The change seems to be related to LANG-1055. Here a fix was implemented which initializes a lookup object for system properties with a snapshot copy of the current properties. Changes made later on system properties are no longer reflected. I do not understand the background for this change because this is not really related to the original bug report.
I would propose an implementation which fixes the reported problem in LANG-1055 and allows a live view on system properties. Maybe the snapshot use case could still be supported by an overloaded method.
