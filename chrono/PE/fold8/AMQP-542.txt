Class-level @RabbitListener causes INFO log message about NullPointerException
If you have a class-level @RabbitListener annotation and some @RabbitHandler methods, when you start your application you&amp;apos;ll get a log message like:
2015-10-15 18:50:15.430  INFO o.s.core.annotation.AnnotationUtils: Failed to introspect annotations on [null]: java.lang.NullPointerException
This appears to be completely harmless and the handler methods are all correctly called for incoming messages, but it makes my team nervous to have NullPointerException messages in our logs that we&amp;apos;re supposed to just ignore.
The current version of Spring Boot&amp;apos;s AMQP sample app (spring-boot-sample-amqp) demonstrates the problem with no changes needed; fire up the example and look for the error just after the "Registering beans for JMX exposure on startup" message.
