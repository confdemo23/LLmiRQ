Allow the Canary in regionserver mode to try all regions on the server, not just one
We want a pretty in-depth canary that will try every region on a cluster. When doing that for the whole cluster one machine is too slow, so we wanted to split it up and have each regionserver run a canary. That works however the canary does less work as it just tries one random region.
Lets add a flag that will allow the canary to try all regions on a regionserver.
