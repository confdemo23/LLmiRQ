DBE&apos;s seekBefore with tags corrupts the tag&apos;s offset information thus leading to incorrect results
The problem occurs with moveToPrevious() case and incase of tags we copy the previous pointer&amp;apos;s tag info to the current because already decoded the tags.
Will check once again before I post other details.  I have a test case to reproduce the problem. Found this while working with MultibyteBuffers and verified if this is present in trunk - it is in all branches where we have tags compression (I suppose) will verify
