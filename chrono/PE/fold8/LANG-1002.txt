Several predefined ISO FastDateFormats in DateFormatUtils are incorrect
Formats ISO_TIME_FORMAT, ISO_TIME_TIME_ZONE_FORMAT prepend a T but this is not correct. Sole time is never prepended by defintion. T is used only when date and time are given.
The Javadocs of ISO_TIME_NO_T_FORMAT, ISO_TIME_NO_T_FORMAT are in correct too because they say: "This pattern does not comply with the formal ISO8601 specification as the standard requires the &amp;apos;T&amp;apos; prefix for times."
You might want to read Markus Kuhn&amp;apos;s reference on that.
A solution would be remove the first two and rename the second two by dropping the NO_T in the name.
