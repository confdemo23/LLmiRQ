Count query creation fails when entity names contain non-ASCII characters
org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.query.QueryUtils.createCountQueryFor(String, String) uses pattern matching to derive the count query. However, this pattern matching does not support the presence of accented letters in entity names.
An example of a query for which the count query computation fails:
select u from Usr u where u.firstname like ?1%
Of course the example is dumb, but in non-English languages entity names might have accents (JPA allows it).
