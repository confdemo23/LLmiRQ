Programmatic JAAS configuration option for secure zookeeper may be broken
While verifying the patch fix for HBASE-13768 we were unable to successfully test the programmatic JAAS configuration option for secure ZooKeeper integration. Unclear if that was due to a bug or incorrect test configuration.
Update the security section of the online book with clear instructions for setting up the programmatic JAAS configuration option for secure ZooKeeper integration.
Verify it works.
Fix as necessary.
