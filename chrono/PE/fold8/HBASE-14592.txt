BatchRestartRsAction always restarts 0 RS when running SlowDeterministicMonkey
When running ITBLL, observed below log and found the ratio of batch restarting is always zero:

15/10/12 17:05:37 INFO actions.Action: Performing action: Batch restarting 0% of region servers



Checking code, found batchRestartRSRatio never got initialized in SlowDeterministicMonkeyFactory, and current ITBLL never check the case of batch RS restarting in actual.
