AppmasterLauncherRunner can call exit() twice causing jvm to block
Its possible for the AppmasterLauncherRunners.class to receive two appmaster state events when being used with StaticAppmaster. This causes System.exit to be called twice and is  causing the jvm to block indefinitely. From the jvm docs for Runtime.exit(),
"If this method is invoked after the virtual machine has begun its shutdown sequence then if shutdown hooks are being run this method will block indefinitely. If shutdown hooks have already been run and on-exit finalization has been enabled then this method halts the virtual machine with the given status code if the status is nonzero; otherwise, it blocks indefinitely.
The System.exit method is the conventional and convenient means of invoking this method."
I get two of these lines in my logs, the second being the last entry.
