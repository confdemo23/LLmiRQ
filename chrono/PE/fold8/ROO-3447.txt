Comment structures added by a builder are not written in the ITD
Builders allow comment structures from Metadata, but  not included in the AJ file when write to disk.
It is possible same problem affects comments into properties, classes, methods, ...
Example:






...




CommentStructure comments = new CommentStructure();




JavadocComment javadoc = new JavadocComment("My javadoc comment");




comments.addComment(javadoc, CommentStructure.CommentLocation.BEGINNING);




...




MethodMetadataBuilder methodBuilder = new MethodMetadataBuilder(...);




methodBuilder.setCommentStructure(comments);




...




builder.addMethod(methodBuilder.build());




itdTypeDetails = builder.build();
