ZipFileDataFormat doesn&apos;t take exchange&apos;s charset into account
ZIP streams are always encoded with the default UTF-8 charset, even if in the Exchange header a different charset is set. (Exchange.CHARSET_NAME)
(Please note that this is my first bugreport and -fix for the camel project, I hope i do it right)
