Reload or Shutdown inside IF statement is performed before the if/else block batch is executed
Executing a reload or shutdown inside an if/else block results in the reload or restart occurring before the other commands in the batch are executed.






if (outcome == success) of /subsystem=logging/logger=org.jboss.as.cli:read-resource()




   /subsystem=logging:write-attribute(name=use-deployment-logging-config




   shutdown --restart=true




end-if






This command will actually leave the server in a reload-required state. The shutdown, or reload, will occur before the write-attribute is executed.
