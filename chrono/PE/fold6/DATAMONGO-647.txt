Using "OrderBy" in "query by method name" ignores the @Field annotation for field alias.
I created a method using the "query by method name" approach:
Inside my Answer object, I have a field called "Score" that is annotated with
@Field("sr")
int Score
List&lt;Answer&gt; findByQuestionIdOrderByScoreDesc(String questionId)
When the query is run, the database attempts to sort the results by "score" rather than my "sr" field name.
