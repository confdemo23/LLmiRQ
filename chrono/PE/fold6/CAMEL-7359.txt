Simple Language - Additional after text after inbuilt function call is ignored
The following Simple expression is valid and runs OK - however it may have been appropriate to report an error to the developer.



            &lt;setBody&gt;

                &lt;simple&gt;${bodyAs(java.lang.String) Additional text ignored...}&lt;/simple&gt;

            &lt;/setBody&gt;



The above seems a somewhat contrived example; However this is a more &amp;apos;realistic&amp;apos; scenario in which the behaviour is not unexpected -



            &lt;setBody&gt;

                &lt;simple&gt;${bodyAs(java.lang.String).toUpperCase()}&lt;/simple&gt;

            &lt;/setBody&gt;



The above simple expression will simply set the body to be of type java.lang.String, however will not invoke the subsequent toUpperCase() call - likewise no error is reported to the developer.
Camel has the same issue when using the function of headerAs and mandatoryBodyAs.
