NotCompliantMBeanException : Attribute MessageHistory has more than one getter
Hello, I wasn&amp;apos;t able to subscribe on the mailing list, so I&amp;apos;m posting my issue directly here.
In my project I need to use some ManagedCamelContextMBean, which I am trying to access through JMX.newMBeanProxy
However, it is not working as I&amp;apos;m getting a NotCompliantMBeanException because the attribute MessageHistory is said to have more than one getter.
I checked the source code of newMBeanProxy, then the JMX 1.4 specification, and then Camel&amp;apos;s source code, and it appears that ManagedCamelContextMBean is indeed not respecting the standard MBean.
The problem is that two methods are defined in ManagedCamelContextMBean : isMessageHistory() and getMessageHistory()
Since the return type is boolean, isMessageHistory is considered to be a getter, which makes two getter according to the JMX specification and is blocking the newMBeanProxy() method.
