JDBC ResultSet fails to get value by qualified projection name
Getting value from result set using fully qualified name would throw exception. Only solution today is to use position of the column as opposed to column label.



String sql = "select r1.x, r2.x from r1 join r2 on r1.y=r2.y";

ResultSet res = stmt.executeQuery(sql);

res.getInt("r1.x");



res.getInt("r1.x"); would throw exception unknown column even though sql specifies it.
Fix is to fix resultsetschema in semantic analyzer.
