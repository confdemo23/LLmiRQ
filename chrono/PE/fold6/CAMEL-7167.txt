AbstractListAggregationStrategy : at the end of the split, the body is not replaced by the agregated list
Using a class that extends AbstractListAggregationStrategy to rebuild a List after the completion of the split cause the body not to be replaced by the agregated list at the end of the split.
In other words (AbstractListAggregationStrategy.onCompletion(Exchange exchange) is never called.
Here is what I do :
from(HANDLE_A_LIST)//
            .split(body(), new ListAggregationStrategy())// body is an arrayList of String
            .to("log:foo")//
            .end()// end split
            // the body is a string instead of a List
            .end()// end route
class ListAggregationStrategy extends AbstractListAggregationStrategy&lt;String&gt;
    {
        @Override
        public String getValue(Exchange exchange)
        {

            return exchange.getIn().getBody();

        }
    }
As workaround, I use .setBody(property(Exchange.GROUPED_EXCHANGE)) after the end of the split.
