Improper JavaDoc comment for FilenameUtils.indexOfExtension
The method FilenameUtils.indexOfExtension contains this JavaDoc comment:
  * @param filename  the filename to find the last path separator in, null returns -1
  * @return the index of the last separator character, or -1 if there
  * is no such character
This comment was obviously copied from the FilenameUtils.indexOfLastSeparator method, where it makes perfect sense.
The JavaDoc comment for FilenameUtils.indexOfExtension should rather read e.g. as follows:
  * @param filename  the filename to find the last extension separator in, null returns -1
  * @return the index of the last extension separator character, or -1 if there
  * is no such character
