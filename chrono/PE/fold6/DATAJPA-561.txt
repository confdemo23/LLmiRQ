Entity with primitive version property invalidly considered not new
Hello,
we have some problems while saving entities with cascading after updating from 1.3.4.RELEASE to 1.6.0.RELEASE.
Calling save with a list of entities will return a list of entities where only one has an ID.
This results in a constraint violation if the corresponding data should be inserted into the database.
Dependencies:
Before (Working):

spring-data-jpa 1.3.4.RELEASE
spring-data-commons 1.7.1.RELEASE
spring 4.0.5.RELEASE
eclipselink 2.5.1

After (Not working):

spring-data-jpa 1.6.0.RELEASE
spring-data-commons 1.8.0.RELEASE
spring 4.0.5.RELEASE
eclipselink 2.5.1

See attachement for JUnit test case.
I hope the single files are ok for you. If not I can upload a complete test project somewhere.
I figured out that the problematic line of code seems to be ChildEntity:52.
Here the child will be added to the list of children in the parent.
I dont know if this is good style but it worked fine with previous version of spring-data.
Is this really a bug or is the style of adding children to parents not more supported?
Thanks and best regards
Dennis
