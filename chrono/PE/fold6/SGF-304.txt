OnMembers function execution with Gemfire Group calls onMember (wrong method)
In class GroupMemberFunctionExecution, line 40:
	@Override
	protected Execution getExecution() 
{
		return FunctionService.onMember(this.groups);
	}

The problem is that it is calling the SINGULAR version of the function, the right one is the PLURAL onMembers method.
