ArchiveStreamFactory throws "No Archiver found for the stream signature" on 7z files
Apache Tika makes use of ArchiveStreamFactory to handle a wide range of archive formats (Zip, AR, CPIO, Tar etc)
We&amp;apos;ve just upgraded to Commons Compress 1.7, and tried to make use of the new 7z support to add in 7z handling too. However, when you try to call:
            ArchiveStreamFactory factory = new ArchiveStreamFactory();
            ArchiveInputStream ais = factory.createArchiveInputStream(stream);
With a 7z file it fails with:
    new ArchiveException("No Archiver found for the stream signature");
