Illegal character &apos;{&apos; in URL when using projection and PUT request
We are calling URL http://localhost:8080/rapnot/companies/4 with PUT method in order to update data.
In the logs, we see this error: 






2014-05-06 10:54:45,688 ERROR [org.springframework.data.rest.webmvc.AbstractRepositoryRestController] Illegal character in path at index 40: http://localhost:8080/rapnot/companies/4{?projection}






The {?projection} has been added to the URL and we get an invalid URL.
The issue seems to be located in this part of the code in org.springframework.data.rest.webmvc.RepositoryEntityController:






private ResponseEntity&lt;ResourceSupport&gt; mergeAndReturn(Object incoming, Object domainObject,




	RepositoryInvoker invoker, HttpMethod httpMethod, PersistentEntityResourceAssembler assembler) {









	









	if (PUT.equals(httpMethod)) {




		headers.setLocation(URI.create(assembler.getSelfLinkFor(obj).getHref()));




	}




	




}






At least, this is where the {?projection} is added to the URL.
