A single call of consumerTemplate.receiveBody consumes more than one messages from a SEDA queue
When using consumer template&amp;apos;s receiveBody on a SEDA queue that has multiple exchanges, a single call of receiveBody consumed more than one messages from the queue.  This happens for both receiveBody and receiveBodyNoWait.
I will attach a test project that can produce this issue.
