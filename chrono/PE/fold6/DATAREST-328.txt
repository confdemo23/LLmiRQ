Serialization errors if type contains only renamed properties
Adding @EnableMongoAuditing to an application configuration causes a few different problems related to (but probably not caused by) Jackson serialization.  These issues can be reproduced by (1) starting an application with @EnableMongoAuditing, (2) POSTing certain types of entities to a RepositoryRestResource, and (3) attempting to GET from the same repository.  
Please refer to the referenced URL for a working example based on the mongodb-data-rest getting-started sample.  Also note the comment with sample command-line input at: https://github.com/ncantelmo/gs-accessing-mongodb-data-rest/commit/988626629a1ef708b5a3d44c4bd8b2874662747f#commitcomment-6740135
Additional notes:

This issue was initially identified in an application that implemented AuditorAware.  The inclusion of an AuditorAware bean appears to make no difference on the described behavior.
The following sequence of events will NOT reveal the issue: (1) POST a new document to some repository X, (2) Restart the application, (3), GET from repository X, (4) POST another document with the same fields to repository X, (5) GET from repository X.
In other words, if you GET from a populated repository before you POST, the serialization routines will work properly.
In the referenced example, removing the @JsonProperty("brand_name") annotation in PetFood.java will prevent serialization from causing a crash.
In root-level entities or immediate nested children, custom @JsonProperty annotations will cause the annotated properties to not be fetched during a GET after an initial POST, but won&amp;apos;t cause a crash.
