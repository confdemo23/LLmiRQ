LikeOperations.getPagesLiked doesn&apos;t get cover obj and link
I tested directly the fb graph api explorer and got the full information. In the Java LikesOPerations call I get all the information less the cover object (id, image url, offsetx, offsety) and the link of the link
Apparently the permissions are the same in the graph api explorer and the fb connect (user_likes,friends_likes,publish_stream,user_photos,offline_access,friends_birthday,friends_location,read_friendlists)
GET me/friends?fields=likes.fields(link,name,website,cover),name,link&amp;limit=5
