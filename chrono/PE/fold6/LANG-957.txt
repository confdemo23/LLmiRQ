WordUtils.wrap(String, int) doesn&apos;t behave according to JavaDoc
The JavaDoc of WordUtils.wrap(String, int) says that leading white spaces on new lines are stripped from the result. However the following test will fail, since the leading spaces of the second line are not stripped from the resultL



@Test

public void testWordUtils_StringInt_LeadingWhitespaces {

        input = "spaces                               spaces";

        expected = "spaces              " + systemNewLine + "spaces";

        assertEquals(expected, WordUtils.wrap(input, 20));

}
