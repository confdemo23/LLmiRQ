LazyArray.getList changes array it previously returned 
Simple query like:
SELECT a, e
FROM ikabiljo_test_string_array
LATERAL VIEW EXPLODE(a) x1 AS e
(table contains one column - ARRAY&lt;STRING&gt; - and has one row - [b,c,a] )
fails with ConcurrentModificationException, since LazyArray.getList changes the cached array it returns.
LazyArray.getList can easily:

return cached array if present, without clearing and refiling. Hive is already not going to work properly if you change input parameters in an UDF. If that doesn&amp;apos;t sound good - it can return Collections.unmodifiableList
or just not cache anything

Same is true for LazyMap.getMap
