deleteBy/removeBy repository methods don&apos;t set type information in Before/AfterDeleteEvent
In AbstractMongoQuery.java the nested DeleteExecution class has the following method






private Object deleteAndConvertResult(Query query, MongoEntityMetadata&lt;?&gt; metadata) {









			if (method.isCollectionQuery()) {




				return operations.findAllAndRemove(query, metadata.getJavaType());




			}









			WriteResult writeResult = operations.remove(query, metadata.getCollectionName());




			return writeResult != null ? writeResult.getN() : 0L;




		}






Here the javatype is not passed to operations.remove method although there is an overloaded method of remove which accepts the type. The result ends up as having null in the type value inside the Before/AfterDeleteEvent and the result events are although fired but never end up handled in the respective Type&amp;apos;s Event Handlers if any.
A simple fix would be to change it to:






WriteResult writeResult = operations.remove(query, metadata.getJavaType(), metadata.getCollectionName());
