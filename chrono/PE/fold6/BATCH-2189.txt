DefaultBatchConfigurer violates PostConstruct rules
When trying to deploy a Spring Batch project in a web container it fails to deploy due to DefaultBatchConfigurer violating the @PostConstruct annotation rule.
http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/5/api/javax/annotation/PostConstruct.html
The DefaultBatchConfigurer can&amp;apos;t throw a checked exception in the initialize method. My suggestion would be to catch whatever exception is being thrown and wrap it in a run time exception.
