ValidatingRepositoryEventListener should use Repositories more lenient
ValidatingRepositoryEventListener uses field injection to access a Repositories instance and does a by-type lookup of components in afterPropertiesSet() which can cause a circular reference on initialization.
We should rather use an ObjectFactory&lt;Repositories&gt; from within the listener so that the container can give us a proxy that will eventually return the Repositories instance but doesn&amp;apos;t have to instantiate Repositories eagerly.
