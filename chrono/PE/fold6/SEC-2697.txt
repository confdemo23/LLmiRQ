Invalid warning logged when using Spring 3.2.10.RELEASE
I&amp;apos;m using Spring Framework (version 3.2.10.RELEASE).
During application startup I&amp;apos;m getting following warning:

org.springframework.security.core.SpringSecurityCoreVersion - **** You are advised to use Spring 3.2.8.RELEASE or later with this version. You are running: 3.2.10.RELEASE
It seems that versions are compared using String.compareTo().
Using this method "3.2.10.RELEASE" is lower then "3.2.8.RELEASE".
