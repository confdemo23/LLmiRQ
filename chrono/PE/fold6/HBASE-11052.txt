Sending random data crashes thrift service
Upstream thrift library has a know issue (THRIFT-601) causing the thrift server to crash with an Out-of-Memory Error when bogus requests are sent.
This reproduces when a very large request size is sent in the request header, making the thrift server to allocate a large memory segment leading to OOM.
LoadBalancer health checks are the first "candidate" for bogus requests
Thrift developers admit this is a known issue with TBinaryProtocol and their recommandation is to use TCompactProtocol/TFramedTransport but this requires all thrift clients to be updated (might not be feasible atm)
So we need a fix similar to CASSANDRA-475.
