RepositoryRelProvider is not registered
Currently there&amp;apos;s bean registered for the RepositoryRelProvider implementation that returns rels based on the mapping information.
This causes components using a RelProvider to calculate rels (in contrast to ones that directly use the ResourceMapping (such as the root controller). This causes different rels being rendered depending on which API a component uses.
