Query methods retuning a single entity does not work with projecting types
Assume the following repository:






interface UserRepository extends CrudRepository&lt;User, BigInteger&gt; {









  UserSummary findSummaryByLastnameLike(String lastname);




}






Assuming that UserSummary does not extend User executing the query method will always return null as the collection the query is run against will be derived from UserSummary which it shouldn&amp;apos;t in this case.
The issue is that SingleEntityExecution does not hand the collection name of the MongoEntityMetadata to the template so that the collection is derived from the return type only.
