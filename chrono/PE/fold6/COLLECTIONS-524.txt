ListOrderedSet can have duplicates
The static method, org.apache.commons.collections.set.ListOrderedSet.decorate(List list), has a comment "If the list contains duplicates, the duplicates are removed".  It does not remove duplicates and will leave you in an inconsistent state if your list has duplicates.  (i.e. the .size() result is smaller than the number of iterations from the iterator)
