@Schedule EJB Timer not using timezone when calculating next timeout
With a system running in Central Timezone, if it uses the annotation below specifying the timezone as Eastern timezone, with the hour set to the current hour.
The timer will fire once, and it will calculate the next timeout to be in the next hour CST, where as it should take in consideration the timezone specified on @Schedule which is Eastern.  If it did, then the timer should continue to fire every minute.






  @Schedule(persistent = false, timezone = "America/New_York", dayOfMonth = "*", dayOfWeek = "*", month = "*", hour = "22", minute = "*", second = "0", year = "*")
