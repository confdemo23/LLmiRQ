Hive HBase query fails on Tez due to missing jars - part 2
Follow-up from HIVE-6739. We cannot wait for Tez 0.4 (or even be sure that it will have TEZ-1004 and TEZ-1005), so I will split the patch into two. Original jira will have the straightforward (but less efficient) fix. This jira will use new relocalize APIs. Depending on relative timing of Tez 0.4 release and Hive 0.13 release, this will go into 0.13 or 0.14 blocked on Tez 0.5
