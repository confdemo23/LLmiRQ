FTP route considers files as in progress after error in poll
When an error occurs in the middle of polling (e.g. read timeout on ftp server), all files that have been read up to that point are stored in the inProgressRepospitory (last line GenericFileConsumer.isValidFile()). Due to the error, those files are not passed on to the ftp route, but remain in the inProgressRepository. The effect is that those files are never picked up unless we clear the inProgressRepository somehow (e.g. by restarting). When polling fails, files should not be allowed to remain in the inProgressRepository
