@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity creates JDK dynamic proxies instead of using AspectJ advices
The following config creates JDK proxies for secured beans preprocessed with an AspectJ compiler, thus rendering AnnotationSecurityAspect useless.
@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(mode=AdviceMode.ASPECTJ, securedEnabled=true)
class SecurityConfig 
{...}

The AspectJMethodSecurityInterceptor that AnnotationSecurityAspect requires appears to only be instantiated by GlobalMethodSecurityBeanDefinitionParser. This implies that AnnotationSecurityAspect is only usable in XML config mode (but not Java config mode).
The attached Gradle project demonstrates this problem.
