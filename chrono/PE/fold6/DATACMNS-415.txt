Performance improvements in configuration subsystem
Original email by Martin Lippert:

The implementation creates a new ClassPathScanningCandidateComponentProvider without setting a MetadataReaderFactory. This causes a new caching metadata reading factory being created every time this method is called, resulting in more or less no caching for the metadata. I am not sure from where to get the appropriate MetadataReaderFactory, but the ConfigurationClassPostProcessor has the right one. I hope there is a way to reuse that, it would reduce the loading and parsing of byte code a lot.
