camel-netty-http doesn&apos;t use "Expect: 100-continue" correctly
Camel-netty-http component, when sending HTTP request with:

Expect: 100-continue



header, always sends the HTTP body with first request and treats:

HTTP/1.1 100 Continue



as final response.
Additionally org.apache.camel.component.netty.http.handlers.HttpServerChannelHandler sends HTTP/1.1 100 Continue partial response after the same partial response was send by org.jboss.netty.handler.codec.http.HttpChunkAggregator#messageReceived
