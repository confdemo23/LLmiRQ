FindAndUpdate broken when using @DbRef and interface as target
NullPointerException is thrown when using MongoTemplate.findAndModify(...) with @DbRef and interface as @DbRef target. See attached project for more details. Probably regression issue since same test is passing with Spring Data Commons 1.6.3.RELEASE and Spring Data MongoDB 1.3.3.RELEASE.
