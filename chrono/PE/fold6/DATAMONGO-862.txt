Update Array Field Using Positional Operator ($) Does Not Work
After updating to a newer version of Spring Data MongoDB, I found that I can no longer update array fields. The most recent version I observed this to work correctly is 1.2.x.
In 1.3.x and above, it seems that the positional operator ($) is removed from the key.
For example:
mongoOps.findAndModify(new Query(), new Update().set("options.$.name", "color"), MongoProduct.class);
In the actual command, "options.$.name" turns into "options.name".
This results in the mongodb error: "exception: can&amp;apos;t append to array using string field name: name"
