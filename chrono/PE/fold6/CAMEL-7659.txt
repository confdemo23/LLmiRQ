camel-atom filter always returns the last consumed entry from feed more than once
I have problem with camel setup to consume feeds atom://atomUri?splitEntries=true&amp;filter=true&amp;throttleEntries=false, feed processor does not skip last consumed entry.
The source of problem is in UpdateDateFilter class, it filters only entries older than last update and entries of same pubdate are once more
consumed.
