Session timeout not detected when enable CSRF protection
settings is following:






    &lt;sec:http auto-config="true" use-expressions="true"&gt;




        &lt;sec:session-management 




            invalid-session-url="/error/sessionError"




            session-authentication-strategy-ref="sessionAuthenticationStrategy" /&gt;




    &lt;/sec:http&gt;






Detected the session time-out when called GET method, but not detected session time-out  when called POST method.
When called POST method, occurred the CSRF token error.
This behavior are best practice in the spring security?
Also When called POST method, i wanted to detect the session time-out.
If wanted to detect the session timeout when called POST method, what should I do?
