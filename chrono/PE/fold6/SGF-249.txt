The SDG XSD is restricting the use of property placeholder values on <gfe:disk-store/>, compaction-threshold attributes given the attribute type is a short and not string.
Current the Spring Data GemFire XML Schema (XSD) restricts the value of the compaction-threshold attribute on the &lt;gfe:disk-store/&gt; element as type &amp;apos;short&amp;apos;, with valid values between 0 and 100, rather than using a type of &amp;apos;string&amp;apos; thereby allowing the use of property placeholder values.
The XSD should be changed so that the GemFire Disk Store, compaction-threshold attribute is of type &amp;apos;xsd:string&amp;apos;, allowing the use of property placeholder values.
