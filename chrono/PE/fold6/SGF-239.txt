The value "XaPooledDataSource" of jndi-binding "type" attribute should be changed to "XAPooledDataSource"
Gemfire expects "XAPooledDataSource" JNDI binding type but schema defines "XaPooledDataSource" enumeration value (I am wondering how does this work for you and whether this functionality was tested at all?).
A workaround could be to turn off validation before refreshing Spring context.
