using findAndModify removes the _class field of encapsulated classes, causing MappingInstantiationException
given the two classes:
public interface IUser{
}
public class User implements IUser{
    public int i;
}
public class UserWrapper{
    private IUser user;
}
when using findAndModify on a UserWrapper collection, 
the "_class" field from the User class is removed.
when trying to restore the UserWrapper class, 
a MappingInstantiationException is being thrown with "Failed to instantiate IUser using constructor NO_CONSTRUCTOR with arguments.
