Direct exchange binding default routing key fails on queue name with dot char
If the queue name for rabbit direct-exchange binding contains a dot character, the default routing key evaluation will fail on non-existing bean &lt;string_before_first_dot&gt;, which unfortunately breaks all our direct-exchange bindings with such queue names.
Following configuration fails on unresolvable bean &amp;apos;communication&amp;apos;.






&lt;rabbit:direct-exchange name="communication.mail"&gt;




  &lt;rabbit:bindings&gt;




    &lt;rabbit:binding queue="communication.mail" /&gt;




  &lt;/rabbit:bindings&gt;




&lt;/rabbit:direct-exchange&gt;






What was the reason behind using SPEL expression as default routing key in DirectExchangeParser?
It would be ok if it&amp;apos;s used with explicitly set key to take advantage of spel evaluation to provide flexible routing keys, but as a default, it&amp;apos;s somehow undocumented hidden breaking magic.
