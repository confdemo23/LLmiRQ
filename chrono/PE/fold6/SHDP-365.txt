Store writer should not fail on lifecycle
OutputStoreObjectSupport is trying to initialize a state by listing output directory for existing files. This operation will fail if hdfs is not available and we would expect things to go south. Problem is that this happens during the bean lifecycle which is extremely inconvenient for user of this component.
We should not fail during the lifecycle start and then do any init work when hdfs is available.
