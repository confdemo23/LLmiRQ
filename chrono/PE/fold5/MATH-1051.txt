EigenDecomposition may not converge for certain matrices
Jama-1.0.3 contains a bugfix for certain matrices where the original code goes into an infinite loop.
The commons-math translations would throw a MaxCountExceededException, so fails to compute the eigen decomposition.
Port the fix from jama to CM.
