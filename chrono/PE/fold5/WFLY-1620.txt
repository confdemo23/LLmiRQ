EJB in CDI enabled module gets registered twice leading to WELD-001409 Ambiguous dependencies...
If you have this no-interface @Stateless EJB in the module and have a
beans.xml inside the module jar as well and then have a deployment
depends on &amp; imports the annotations, and then uses @Inject TestEjb,
Weld will complain that there are two options an EJB and a ManagedBean
and it doesn&amp;apos;t know which to inject. According to [1] it should only be
considered a managed bean if "It is not annotated with an EJB
component-defining annotation or declared as an EJB bean class in



ejb-jar.xml
."



The error:
WELD-001409 Ambiguous dependencies for type [TestEjb] with qualifiers [@Default] at injection point [[field] @Inject test.webapp.TestService.testEjb].
Possible dependencies [[Session bean [class test.TestEjb with qualifiers [@Any @Default]; local interfaces are [TestEjb], Managed Bean [class test.TestEjb] with qualifiers [@Any @Default]]] 
@Stateless
public class TestEjb
{
public String hello() 
{

return "Hello";

}
}
If I move all of the classes into the test war, then Weld doesn&amp;apos;t have
an issue, so it seems there is some difference when the code is put into
the modules directory.
