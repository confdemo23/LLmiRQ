AuthorizationRequest is no longer Serializable, cannot be used in distributable applications
As of commit 9704cf66181cb1179bd02dad8cf63c0e77cf8ebc, AuthorizationRequest is no longer Serializable. Because of this, any Spring Security OAuth 2 applications cannot be marked with &lt;distributable /&gt; in the deployment descriptor. Doing so results in this error whenever a user attempts to authorize:
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Non-serializable attribute authorizationRequest
I am unable to even test out Spring Security OAuth 2 1.1.0.M1 and Java Config. I am completely blocked by this problem, for which there is no workaround. My application must be distributable; taking that off is not an option.
Can we get this fixed and have M2 released ASAP, please!?
