Regression - HiveConf static variable causes issues in long running JVM instances with /tmp/ data
With Hive 0.8.x, HiveConf was changed to utilize the private, static member "confVarURL" which points to /tmp/hive-&lt;user&gt;-&lt;tmp_number&gt;.xml for job configuration settings. 
During long running JVMs, such as a Beeswax server, which creates multiple HiveConf objects over time this variable does not properly get updated between jobs and can cause job failure if the OS cleans /tmp/ during a cron job.
