Spring Data for MongoDb doesn&apos;t save null values when @Version is added to domain class 
Scenario:
1. Domain class is loaded from mongodb using CrudRepository.findOne() method.
2. The loaded instances any non id nor @Version annotated field is set to null. 
3. The loaded instance is saved to same mongodb using CrudRepository.save() method.
4. The field that has been set to null doesnt write to database, its unchanged.
Important: The problem doesnt occur when @Version annotation is not used in the domain class definition.
