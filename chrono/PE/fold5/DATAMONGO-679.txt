MongoTemplate.doSave() passed a JSON String doesn&apos;t save it.
I have Spring 3.1.2 setup to TEXT messages off a queue(that contain JSON), then insert them into a mongo database.
The MongoTemplate.doSave(..) method is passed in 
collectionName = "audit_log"
objectToSave = "{"nanosecond":528023582734299,"clientID":"300","action":"ENTRY"";
writer = MappingMongoConvertor()
These are all correct.
The code though has this...
if (!(objectToSave instanceof String)) {
	writer.write(objectToSave, dbDoc);
} else {
	try 
{
		objectToSave = (T) JSON.parse((String) objectToSave);
	}
 catch (JSONParseException e) 
{
		throw new MappingException("Could not parse given String to save into a JSON document!", e);
	}
}
maybeEmitEvent(new BeforeSaveEvent&lt;T&gt;(objectToSave, dbDoc));
Object id = saveDBObject(collectionName, dbDoc, objectToSave.getClass());
So the objectToSave is a String, so the first IF statement fails, and it goes into the ELSE section.
The &amp;apos;objectToSave&amp;apos; is then correctly pasrsed into a BasicDBObject with the correct values.
The saveDBObject() method though is not passed in the objectToSave.
Its passed in the collectionName (which is correct). 
The dbDoc which is empty since we&amp;apos;ve put nothing into it.
and the objectToSave.getClass()
So how will it ever save the objectToSave if its not passed into the save method ??
I suspect it should have something like...
objectToSave = (T) JSON.parse((String) objectToSave);
followed by
dbDoc = (com.mongodb.BasicDBObject)objectToSave
Note my spring config is using a int-jms:channel to wire in the queue to Mongo.
&lt;int-jms:channel id="saveToDBChannel"  
    	queue-name="ESI_AUDIT" 
    	auto-startup="true" concurrency="50"&gt;
    &lt;/int-jms:channel&gt;
    &lt;int-mongodb:outbound-channel-adapter id="outBoundMongoAdapter"
        collection-name="audit_log"  
        mongodb-factory="mongoDbFactory" channel="saveToDBChannel" /&gt;
If you require a WAR that is a test of this, please let me know.
Thanks
