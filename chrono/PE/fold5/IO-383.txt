FileUtils.doCopyFile caches the file size; needs to be documented
FileUtils.doCopyFile saves the input file size before starting the copy.
The copy is considered complete when the original file size is reached.
The method then checks the new input file size against the destination size.
This will fail if the file has changed in size since the copy started.
This behaviour should be documented; also it would help if the two sizes were shown in the exception message.
