ConcurrentSessionFilter documentation incorrectly states it doesn&apos;t rely on SecurityContextHolder, results in null to all logout handlers Authentication object
According to the docs here:
http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/docs/3.1.x/reference/springsecurity-single.html#d0e3278
The location of the filter is:
"2) ConcurrentSessionFilter, because it doesn&amp;apos;t use any SecurityContextHolder functionality..."
But as you can see in this line here, it is used. 
https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-security/blob/master/web/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/web/session/ConcurrentSessionFilter.java#L133
It never gets populated due to the location in the filter chain and the Authentication object is always null.
