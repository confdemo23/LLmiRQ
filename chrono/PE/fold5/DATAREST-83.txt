Controller implementations should not be annotated with @Controller
The controller implementations are currently annotated with @Controller which causes issues when you use Spring Data REST in the same application context in which you have Spring MVC activated through @EnableWebMvc. The latter registers a RequestHandlerMapping that scans the ApplicationContext for all beans annotated with @Controller and will find the SD REST controllers. As the RequestHandlerMapping has higher precedence than the RepositoryRestHandlerMapping it will take over the execution of the controllers which causes trouble in case the additional functionality applied in RRHM is (e.g. baseUri configuration etc.) needed.
Actually the classes don&amp;apos;t need to be annotated with @Controller as they are registered explicitly and the RRHM explicitly considers these classes anyway.
