WAR_BUNDLES_JSF_IMPL does not work for EAR files
Hello Learned and Astonishly Charming JBoss Associates,
I&amp;apos;ve been trying for quite some time now to get my successfully deployed WAR to become a successfully deployed EAR.  Much to my chagrin, this has been my white whale, and it just might kill me.
In a nutshell, the attached EAR file contains a WAR.  If you deploy that WAR file everything works smooth as butter.  As soon as you put it in an EAR format however, you get the following well placed riposte:
19:33:57,513 WARN  [org.jboss.as.jsf] (MSC service thread 1-2) JBAS012603: Unknown JSF version &amp;apos;WAR_BUNDLES_JSF_IMPL&amp;apos;.  Default version &amp;apos;main&amp;apos; will be used instead.
Not cool, JBoss.  Not cool.
I&amp;apos;ve tried moving the jars to different places in the WAR/EAR.  I&amp;apos;ve tried using Manifest files.  I&amp;apos;ve tried colorfully adorned four letter expletives.  JBoss is unmoved.  Does anyone know why JBoss is rejecting my JSF advances?  Can the relationship be fixed?
Using EAP 6.1 which I believe is equivalent to AS 7.2.
Thanks in advance,
Will
