IndexInfo cannot be read for indices created via mongo shell
As described in the stackoverflow post, spring mongo data cannot retrieve the index information for an index that has been created via the mongo shell.
Trisha from 10gen traced the root cause down to this:
"I would recommend reporting this to the guys at Spring, you will not be the only one who experiences this. I found the problem in DefaultIndexOperations lines 138 - 141 in version 1.1.1 of spring-data-mongodb."
I figure this issue also exists in later versions though I did not get around to test it myself.
