Wrong RabbitMQ credentials are not considered as fatal error by SimpleMessageListenerContainer
If I connect an AmqpInboundChannelAdapter to the RabbitMQ (3.1.0) with wrong credentials (wrong password) the SimpleMessageListenerContainer doesn&amp;apos;t detect the real reason and continues to restart the consumer in a seemingly endless loop. As AmqpInboundChannelAdapter user, I don&amp;apos;t notice (except if I turn on debug logging level) any problem, its start() method returns after a pause with no error, but the connection remains not established.
It would be nice to have a notification (exception) about wrong credentials right away (there is a comprehensive rabbit client exception that gets swallowed in SimpleMessageListenerContainer.run())
