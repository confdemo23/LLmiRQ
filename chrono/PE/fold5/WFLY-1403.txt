RolloutPlanTestCase#testMaxFailServersPercentageRolloutPlan incorrectly refers to a rollout plan from different test method
The RolloutPlanTestCase#testMaxFailServersPercentageRolloutPlan in the domain mode testsuite contains a bug as it refers to &amp;apos;maxFailOnePlan&amp;apos; plan instead of &amp;apos;maxFailPercPlan&amp;apos;. Hence, if the test methods are not run in alphabetical order they will fail due to this bug.
This has been somewhat fixed by adding an explicit ordering of test methods in that class, but this is a workaround rather than a fix.
