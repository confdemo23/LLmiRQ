Diamond Syntax:






List&lt;String&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();






Roo error: Encountered " "&lt;" "&lt; "" at line 23, column 42.


Try with Resources






try (FileInputStream in = new FileInputStream("readme.txt")) 




{          




    System.out.println(in.read());




}...

Japa (Java Parser used in Roo) is obsolete project that supports 1.5
Either japa should be modified or new java parser selected for future releases.
