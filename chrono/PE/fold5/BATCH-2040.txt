Db2PagingQueryProvider creates erroneous Statement in generateJumpToItemQuery
Hi,
we want to use the spring-batch-admin on WAS70 with DB2-Database underlying.
The list of executions is delimited to 20 per default. If we try to jump on the next page, an internal server error 500 will occur. 
As we hit the "next" button, the method generateJumpToItemQuery(int itemIndex, int pageSize) in org.springframework.batch.item.database.support.Db2PagingQueryProvider is called.
The generated SQL-Statement is:
SELECT E.JOB_EXECUTION_ID FROM ( SELECT E.JOB_EXECUTION_ID, ROW_NUMBER() OVER ( ORDER BY E.JOB_EXECUTION_ID DESC) AS ROW_NUMBER FROM T1100Z.BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION E, T1100Z.BATCH_JOB_INSTANCE I WHERE E.JOB_INSTANCE_ID=I.JOB_INSTANCE_ID) AS TMP_SUB WHERE TMP_SUB.ROW_NUMBER = 20 ORDER BY E.JOB_EXECUTION_ID DESC
After a few test i found out the right SQL:
SELECT TMP_SUB.JOB_EXECUTION_ID FROM ( SELECT E.JOB_EXECUTION_ID, ROW_NUMBER() OVER ( ORDER BY E.JOB_EXECUTION_ID DESC) AS ROW_NUMBER FROM T1100Z.BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION E, T1100Z.BATCH_JOB_INSTANCE I WHERE E.JOB_INSTANCE_ID=I.JOB_INSTANCE_ID) AS TMP_SUB WHERE TMP_SUB.ROW_NUMBER = 20 ORDER BY TMP_SUB.JOB_EXECUTION_ID DESC
As you can see, the subquery uses the "E.", but comes out as TMP_SUB.
The "E." is set by the batch-admin-manager: sortKeys.put("E.JOB_EXECUTION_ID", Order.DESCENDING);
I think a the generateJumpToItemQuery-Method in Db2PagingQueryProvider has to be overridden, or the method buildSortKeySelect(StringBuilder sql) could get a brother like: buildSortKeySelect(StringBuilder sql, String qualifierReplacement) ("E." -&gt; "TMP_SUB.")
