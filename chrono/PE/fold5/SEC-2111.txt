Disable auto save of SecurityContext when response committed after startAsync invoked
Updated Description
Previously Spring Security would disable automatically saving the SecurityContext when the Thread was different than the Thread that created the SaveContextOnUpdateOrErrorResponseWrapper. This worked for many cases, but could cause issues when a timeout occurred. The problem is that a Thread can be reused to process the timeout since the Threads are pooled. This means that a timeout of a request trigger an apparent logout as described in the following workflow:

The SecurityContext was established on the SecurityContextHolder
An Async request was made
The SecurityContextHolder would be cleared out
The Async request times out
The Async request would be dispatched back to the container upon
        timing out. If the container reused the same Thread to process the
        timeout as the original request, Spring Security would attempt to
        save the SecurityContext when the response was committed. Since the
        SecurityContextHolder was still cleared out it removes the
        SecurityContext from the HttpSession

Spring Security should prevent the SecurityContext from automatically being saved when the response is committed as soon as ServletRequest#startAsync() or   ServletRequest#startAsync(ServletRequest,ServletResponse) is called as apposed to looking at the Thread equality.
Original Description
I still see the same behavior on DeferredResult controllers. (after some time there is an auto logout)
It doesn&amp;apos;t always happen as it used to before 3.2.0.M1 .
Logs are just before logging out occurs and are related to an AJAX call to a deferredResult method.
