FastDateParser does not handle non-Gregorian calendars properly
The following calendars are non-Gregorian [1]:
ja_JP_JP - Japanese Imperial)
th_TH (with any variant) - Thai Buddhist
This causes errors when testing round-trip conversions.
The simplest solution is to fall back to SimpleDateFormat for these calendars.
