Mandatory transitive dependency to Spring HATEOS errantly added in 1.6
The documentation for @EnableSpringDataWebSupport says this:
Annotation to automatically register the following beans for usage with Spring MVC.

DomainClassConverter - to allow usage of domain types managed by Spring Data repositories as controller method arguments bound with PathVariable or RequestParam.
PageableHandlerMethodArgumentResolver - to allow injection of Pageable instances into controller methods automatically created from request parameters.
SortHandlerMethodArgumentResolver - to allow injection of Sort instances into controller methods automatically created from request parameters.

If Spring HATEOAS is present on the classpath we will additionally register the following beans:

PagedResourcesAssembler - for injection into web components
PagedResourcesAssemblerArgumentResolver - for injection of
PagedResourcesAssembler into controller methods


However, this is not correct, and a mandatory transient dependency on Spring HATEOAS has now been added in Spring Data 1.6. Neither @EnableSpringDataWebSupport, PageableHandlerMethodArgumentResolver, nor SortHandlerMethodArgumentResolver may be used if you don&amp;apos;t have Spring HATEOAS on the classpath.
If you use @EnableSpringDataWebSupport you get a NoClassDefFoundError on application startup for org/springframework/hateoas/mvc/UriComponentsContributor. If you use the PageableHandlerMethodArgumentResolver or SortHandlerMethodArgumentResolver directly you get a compilation error for missing class org.springframework.hateoas.mvc.UriComponentsContributor. This is because PageableHandlerMethodArgumentResolver and SortHandlerMethodArgumentResolver both extend UriComponentsContributor.
This is a MAJOR problem. Spring Data users must now include Spring HATEOAS in their application even if they aren&amp;apos;t using it, and HATEOAS comes with its own significant set of transient dependencies. The HATEOAS components should be separated from PageableHandlerMethodArgumentResolver and SortHandlerMethodArgumentResolver so that they can be used without HATEOAS on the classpath.
