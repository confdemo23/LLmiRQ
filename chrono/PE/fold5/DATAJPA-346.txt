Sort by property of an associated object doesn&apos;t work. Join type should be LEFT OUTER JOIN for sorting on associated objects.
The issue I have is that I try to order by a property in an associated object (composite pattern). Thus I have a class PreApprovalRequest and a property in that class assignedTo of type PaceUser. I am trying to order requests by the name of the assignedTo user.
Concrete code below. I have a call that loads all PreApprovalRequest objects (for simplicity I&amp;apos;ll leave out pagination). E.g.






 select * from PreApprovalRequest






That translates to:






select * from ( select preapprova0_.ID as ID0_, preapprova0_.CREATED as CREATED0_ from PRE_APPROVAL_REQUEST preapprova0_ order by preapprova0_.CREATED desc ) where rownum &lt;= ?






Now, when I apply the ordering by first name and then last name of the assignedTo user, the query translates into:






select * from ( select preapprova0_.ID as ID0_, preapprova0_.CREATED as CREATED0_ from PRE_APPROVAL_REQUEST preapprova0_, PACE_USER paceuser1_ where preapprova0_.ASSIGNED_TO=paceuser1_.ID order by lower(paceuser1_.FIRST_NAME) asc, lower(paceuser1_.LAST_NAME) asc ) where rownum &lt;= ?






Note that because the join used when applying sorting is the default one (not using the JOIN keyword) - which is basically INNER JOIN - the items where there is no user assigned to the request will be filtered out, which is not desired of course.
Thus, I think the solution is to join using LEFT OUTER JOIN instead of default join and that should fix it.
I&amp;apos;m happy to clone the repository and add the fix if needed.
Thanks,
Iulian.
