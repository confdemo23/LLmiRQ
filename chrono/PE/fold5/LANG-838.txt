ArrayUtils removeElements methods clone temporary index arrays unnecessarily
The private method removeAll(Object array, int... indices) sorts the indices array, so arrays passed in by application code need to be cloned first.
However, where the index array is generated locally, that is unnecessary.
The removeElements() methods currently call the public removeAll(&lt;type&gt;[] array, int... indices) methods, which clone the indices before calling the private removeAll() method.
The removeElements() methods should call the private method directly, avoiding the unnecessary clone call.
