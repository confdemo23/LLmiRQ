TarArchiveEntry getName() returns wrongly encoded name even when you set encoding to TarArchiveInputStream
I have two file systems. One is Red Hat Linux, the other is MS Windows.
I created a *.tgz file in Red Hat Linux and tried to decompress it in MS Windows using Commons Compress.
The default system encoding are different. UTF-8 in Red Hat Linux and CP949 in MS Windows.
It seems that the file name encoding follows the default encoding even though when I use the following to untar it.
FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(new File(*.tgz));
TarArchiveInputStream zis = new TarArchiveInputStream(new BufferedInputStream(fis),encodingOfRedHatLinux);
while ((entry = (TarArchiveEntry)zis.getNextEntry()) != null)
{

entry.getName(); // filename is not UTF-8 it is encoded in CP949 and so the filename isn&amp;apos;t consistent

}

By referring to this
    /**

Constructor for TarInputStream.
@param is the input stream to use
@param encoding name of the encoding to use for file names
@since Commons Compress 1.4
     */
    public TarArchiveInputStream(InputStream is, String encoding) 
{

        this(is, TarBuffer.DEFAULT_BLKSIZE, TarBuffer.DEFAULT_RCDSIZE, encoding);

    }

encoding should be used for file names.
But actually this doesn&amp;apos;t seem to work.
