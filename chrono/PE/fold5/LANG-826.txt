FastDateParser does not handle non-ASCII digits correctly
The FastDateParser class assumes that all numbers are ascii digits.
However, that is not the case for some locales such as
ja_JP_JP, hi_IN, th_TH, and th_TH_TH
Rather than using "\d", the code needs to match using "\p
{IsNd}
" which is the Unicode class for numeric digits.
