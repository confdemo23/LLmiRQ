ProviderManager doesn&apos;t report InternalAuthenticationServiceExceptions
If the ProviderManager has multiple AuthenticationProviders and one of the earlier providers throws an InternalAuthenticationServiceException then it will not be reported if a later provider throws any kind of AuthenticationException.
I experienced this when the errors that were occurring from a misconfigured LDAP provider were masked by the UsernameNotFoundException from the subsequent dao provider.
Given the javadocs for InternalAuthenticationServiceException it sounds like these errors should be logged even if a subsequent authentication provider succeeds (or fails).  Perhaps ProviderManager.authenticate() should have a special case for handling IASEs like it does for {{AccountStatusException}}s.
