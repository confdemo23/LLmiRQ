SwitchUserFilter is outputting false error logging.
The code introduced in SEC-1763 calls code expecting an exception to be thrown.  It catches the exception in some cases as noop but logs it as an error.  This happens the first time a user logins as using the SwitchUserFilter.  
SwitchUserFilter:296:
        try 
{
            // SEC-1763. Check first if we are already switched.
            currentAuth = attemptExitUser(request);
        }
 catch (AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException e) 
{
            currentAuth = SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication();
        }

See how it calls attemptExitUser(request).  If it is the first time being switched, an exception will be called and treated as a no-op.
Here&amp;apos;s attemptExitUser():
        if (original == null) 
{
            logger.error("Could not find original user Authentication object!");
            throw new AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException(messages.getMessage(
                    "SwitchUserFilter.noOriginalAuthentication",
                    "Could not find original Authentication object"));
        }

That logger.error statement should be removed.
