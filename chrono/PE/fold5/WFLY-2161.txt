JBAS014356 exception not thrown for @Asyncronous EJB methods
If you call an ejb method with default visibility (e.g. from a servlet in the same package), an EJBException with code JBAS014356 is thrown because the method is not public.
If the method is annotated with @Asynchronous and returns void, the exception is not seen because the interceptor from AsyncFutureInterceptorFactory is used before NotBusinessMethodInterceptor, the exception is thrown in the worker thread instead.
With a void return, the exception is silently dropped. With a Future&lt;?&gt; return, it will be set as the failure exception on the future rather than being thrown from the call.
As per the forum reference we need to check the spec, but the validity of the business method should probably be checked before the handoff to the worker thread.
