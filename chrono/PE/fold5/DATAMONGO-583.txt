Check if you are using for loop with a DBCursor
The mongodb driver has a possible memory leak, when using a DBCursor with a for loop:






DBCursor cursor = c.find();




try {




    for (DBObject obj: cursor) {




        if (someCondition(obj)) {




            return obj;




        }




    }




} finally {




    cursor.close();




}






Please see here:
https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/JAVA-664
Please check this case is used and maybe switch to a while(cursor.hasNext())
