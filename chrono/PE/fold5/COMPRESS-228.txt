ZipException on reading valid zip64 file
ZipFile zip = new ZipFile(new File("ordertest-64.zip")); throws ZipException "central directory zip64 extended information extra field&amp;apos;s length doesn&amp;apos;t match central directory data.  Expected length 16 but is 28".
The archive was created by using DotNetZip-WinFormsTool uzing zip64 flag (forces always to make zip64 archives).
Zip file is tested from the console: $zip -T ordertest-64.zip
Output:
test of ordertest-64.zip OK
I can open the archive with FileRoller without problem on my machine, browse and extract it.
