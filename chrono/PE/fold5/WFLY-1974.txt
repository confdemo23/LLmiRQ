@Resource ManagedExecutorService produces a null field
I compiled the latest WildFly master and tried:






@Resource




private ManagedExecutorService managedExecutorService






However, the injected field managedExecutorService is null. This issue is gone when I use:






@Resource(mappedName = "java:comp/DefaultManagedExecutorService")
