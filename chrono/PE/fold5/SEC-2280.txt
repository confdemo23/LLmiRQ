Fix SessionFixationConfigurer#changeSessionId Javadoc
The Javadoc for SessionFixationConfigurer#changeSessionId() was copied and pasted from SessionFixationConfigurer#none() and never updated. It is incorrect. This commit fixes that. It also adds a newline at the end of the file, which the file was missing, causing Git to complain.
