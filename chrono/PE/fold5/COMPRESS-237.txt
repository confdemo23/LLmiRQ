Long link support for TarArchiveOutputStream
TarArchiveOutputStream doesn&amp;apos;t handle properly long link names, they are truncated silently in most cases.

In GNU mode a @LongLink entry should be created similarly to long names but with the &amp;apos;K&amp;apos; type (GNU_LONGLINK) instead of &amp;apos;L&amp;apos; (GNU_LONGNAME)
In POSIX mode a pax header with the linkpath keyword should be added. This is already implemented for links containing a non ASCII character.
In the default ERROR mode no exception is thrown and the link is truncated.

The logic for adding a pax header on non ASCII characters should probably be reworked, as it seems possible to have pax headers mixed with GNU @LongLink entries. I&amp;apos;m not sure this is desirable.
