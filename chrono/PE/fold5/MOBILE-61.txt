SiteSwitcherRequestFilter - initFilterBean() overwrites values from constructor
The SiteSwitcherRequestFilter provides two constructors: the default constructor and one where all the SiteUrlFactories etc. can be specified.
We need to use the last-mentioned (with a DelegatingFilterProxy) since we want to configure our own implementation of the SiteUrlFactory (which always redirects to the same url - we named it StaticSiteUrlFactory).
Unfortunately our configuration gets overwritten in the initFilterBean-method.
