Firefox OS user agent missing
Hi,
I usually use Spring Framework on my project with Spring Mobile on them to be able to know if users are on mobile or not to put correct view...
Some users are now on mobile with Firefox OS and not have mobile but desktop view.
For information, user agent of Firefox OS is : 






Mozilla/5.0 (Mobile; rv:15.0) Gecko/15.0 Firefox/15.0






So when i try to use user agent switcher on firefox to try that user agent, i don&amp;apos;t have mobile view but normal view. So it means that the Device recovered by the DeviceResolver answer "false" on device.isMobile()
I actually work with 1.0.1.RELEASE version of spring mobile
Thanks for your help
