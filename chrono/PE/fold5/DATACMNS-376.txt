Repositories cannot deal with CGLib proxied classes
If you ask Repositories for a RepositoryInformation or PersistentEntity and pass a proxy class of a type type that is actually managed by the Repositories instance it currently returns null as the RepositoryFactoryInformation lookup fails. This is due to the lookup not actually looking up the information for the user class but the proxied one.
