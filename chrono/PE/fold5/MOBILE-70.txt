Absolute URLs are not handled correctly when redirecting
The LiteDeviceDelegatingViewResolver does not correctly handle absolute URLs when redirecting.
For example, the following URL, 






redirect:http://www.google.com/






redirects to  






www.website.com/context/mobile/http://www.google.com/
