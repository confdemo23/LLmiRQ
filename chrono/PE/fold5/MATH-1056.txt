Small error in PoissonDistribution.nextPoisson() algorithm
Here&amp;apos;s a tiny bug I noticed via static inspection, since it flagged the integer division. PoissonDistribution.java:325 says:



final double a1 = FastMath.sqrt(FastMath.PI * twolpd) * FastMath.exp(1 / 8 * lambda);



The "1 / 8 * lambda" is evidently incorrect, since this will always evaluate to 0. I rechecked the original algorithm (http://luc.devroye.org/devroye-poisson.pdf) and it should instead be:



final double a1 = FastMath.sqrt(FastMath.PI * twolpd) * FastMath.exp(1 / (8 * lambda));



(lambda is a double so there is no int division issue.) This matches a later expression.
I&amp;apos;m not sure how to evaluate the effect of the bug. Better to be correct of course; it may never have made much practical difference.
