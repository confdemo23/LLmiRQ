Blackberry 10 user agent missing
Hi,
I&amp;apos;m working with a blackberry 10 simulator and it never detect this device as mobile. I reviewed the KNOWN_MOBILE_USER_AGENT_KEYWORDS variable and I think it&amp;apos;s only add the "touch" as new keyworkd, I&amp;apos;m not sure 
There is the user agent example:
Mozilla/5.0 (BB10; Touch) AppleWebKit/537.3+ (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/10.0.9.386 Mobile Safari/537.3+
And here the description of user agent for this device:
