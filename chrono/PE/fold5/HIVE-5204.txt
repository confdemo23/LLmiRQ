Change type compatibility methods to use PrimitiveCategory rather than TypeInfo
The type compatibility methods in the FunctionRegistry (getCommonClass, implicitConvertable) compare TypeInfo objects directly when its doing its type compatibility logic. This won&amp;apos;t work as well with qualified types (varchar, char, decimal), because we will need different TypeInfo objects to represent varchar(5) and varchar(10), and the equality comparisons won&amp;apos;t work anymore. We can change this logic to look at the PrimitiveCategory for the TypeInfo instead.
