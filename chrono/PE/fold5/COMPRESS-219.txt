ZipArchiveInputStream: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when extracting a STORED zip file entry from within a zip.
When trying to read out a ZIP file, that has been stored (Method STORE, not DEFLATE!, with DEFLATE it seems OK) in another ZIP file using the ZipArchiveInputStream, I do get an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when doing the arraycopy in ZipArchiveInputStream#readStored(byte[], int, int) (line 362) because the "toRead" is not decreased by the buf.offsetInBuffer.
I will add the zip in question as attachment.
