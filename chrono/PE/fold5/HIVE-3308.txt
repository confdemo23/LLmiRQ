Mixing avro and snappy gives null values
On default hive uses LazySimpleSerDe for output.
When I now enable compression and "select count from avrotable" the output is a file with the .avro extension but this then will display null values since the file is in reality not an avro file but a file created by LazySimpleSerDe using compression so should be a .snappy file.
This causes any job (exception select * from avrotable is that not truly a job) to show null values.
If you use any serde other then avro you can temporarily fix this by setting "set hive.output.file.extension=.snappy" and it will correctly work again but this won&amp;apos;t work on avro since it overwrites the hive.output.file.extension during initializing.
When you dump the query result into a table with "create table bla as" you can rename the .avro file into .snappy and the "select from bla" will also magiacally work again.
Input and Ouput serdes don&amp;apos;t always match so when I use avro as an input format it should not set the hive.output.file.extension.
Onces it&amp;apos;s set all queries will use it and fail making the connection useless to reuse.
