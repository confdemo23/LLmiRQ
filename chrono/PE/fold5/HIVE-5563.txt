Skip reading columns in ORC for count(*)
With HIVE-4113, the semantics of ColumnProjectionUtils.getReadColumnIds was fixed so that an empty list means no columns instead of all columns. (Except the caveat of the override of ColumnProjectionUtils.isReadAllColumns.)
However, ORC&amp;apos;s reader wasn&amp;apos;t updated so it still reads all columns.
