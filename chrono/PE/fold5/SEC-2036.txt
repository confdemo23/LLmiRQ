CookieClearingLogoutHandler doesn&apos;t work with IE for default context
The CookieClearingLogoutHandler uses request.getContextPath() to unset the cookie(s). 






 for (String cookieName : cookiesToClear) {




            Cookie cookie = new Cookie(cookieName, null);




            cookie.setPath(request.getContextPath());




            cookie.setMaxAge(0);




            response.addCookie(cookie);




        }






So in default context this method return "" (empty string).
The empty cookie path semantic is expected as "/" by browsers. They all interpret it except IE.
In my case, I use Simple Hash-Based RememberMe Token that can&amp;apos;t be unset and so, users can&amp;apos;t logout from IE.
