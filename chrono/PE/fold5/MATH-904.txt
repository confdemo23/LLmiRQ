FastMath.pow deviates from Math.pow for negative, finite base values with an exponent 2^52 < y < 2^53 
As reported by Jeff Hain:
pow(double,double):
Math.pow(-1.0,5.000000000000001E15) = -1.0
FastMath.pow(-1.0,5.000000000000001E15) = 1.0
===&gt; This is due to considering that power is an even
integer if it is &gt;= 2^52, while you need to test
that it is &gt;= 2^53 for it.
===&gt; replace
"if (y &gt;= TWO_POWER_52 || y &lt;= -TWO_POWER_52)"
with
"if (y &gt;= 2*TWO_POWER_52 || y &lt;= -2*TWO_POWER_52)"
and that solves it.
