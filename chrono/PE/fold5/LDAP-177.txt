LdapUtils convertLdapException fails to convert exceptions when they are extended
Changes to LdapUtils were made to facilitate LDAP-100. However, by changing the checks to be based on the class, versus doing an instanceof comparison, sub-classes of the exceptions do not meet the condition and are all being classified as UncategorizedLdapException.
For example, the javax.naming.NameNotFoundException is defined by Apache DS as LdapNameNotFoundException extends javax.naming.NameNotFoundException
