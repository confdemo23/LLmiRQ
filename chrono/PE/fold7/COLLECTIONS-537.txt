PredicateUtils (all|any)Predicate type misbehaviour Array vs. Collection
Migrating from collections-generic to collections4 we encountered a type problem with PredicateUtils. When you look at the method anyPredicate(), the signature with array is typed with "Predicate&lt;? super T&gt;" whereas the signature with Collection is typed "? extends Predicate&lt;T&gt;", so the both methods are not equivalent.
We think both methods should have the same types, so it would not break compatibility with a lot of legacy code.
