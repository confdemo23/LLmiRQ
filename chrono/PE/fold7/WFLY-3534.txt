Transaction is not being shared by different operations within the same thread
When injecting a JPA-based PartitionManager configuration in a EJB as follows:






    @Resource(mappedName = "picketlink/JPADSBasedPartitionManager")




    private PartitionManager jpaDSBasedPartitionManager;






The IDM operations are executed without share the same EntityManager instance. This causes some strange behaviors such as not being able to retrieve data stored from a previous operation  during a method execution.
