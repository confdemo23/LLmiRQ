AbstractPreAuthenticatedProcessingFilter requires authentication check failure
In the AbstractPreAuthenticatedProcessingFilter.requiresAuthentication(HttpServletRequest request) method which is private, there is the following code:
        Object principal = getPreAuthenticatedPrincipal(request);
        if (currentUser.getName().equals(principal)) 
{
            return false;
        }

This assumes that the overriden method of getPreAuthenticatedPrincipal(request) will always return a String, when in fact it could be any object. This needs to change to either:
		String principal = request.getUserPrincipal().getName();
		if (currentUser.getName().equals(principal)) 
{
			return false;
		}
or provide an abstract method (or at least a protected/public method) in order to do the comparison - see attachment. My getPreAuthenticatedPrincipal(request) returns a FederationPrincipal, and not a String. The only way to deal with it at the moment is to completely copy the AbstractPreAuthenticatedProcessingFilter, and change the tiny bit of code above.
