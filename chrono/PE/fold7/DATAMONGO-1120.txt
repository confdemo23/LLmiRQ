Pageable queries timeout or return incorrect counts
Counts for total elements and pages on some repositories return 0 and some throw a 500 when the socket times out.  This is ONLY occurring on calls that return a Page object and accept a Pageable input.  After debugging a bit, the inputs all seem to be populated from the controller fine.  The query definitions are
findByActiveIsTrue = wrong counts for totalElements and totalPages. both are 0
findByUserId = this collection is large at around 3 million records, but is indexed.
This is only happening in 1.6.1 and works correctly in 1.6.0
