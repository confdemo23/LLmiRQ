AbstractStorelessUnivariateStatistic should not extend AbstractUnivariateStatistic
For a storeless statistic it is wrong to extend AbstractUnivariateStatistic as various fields and methods are inherited that do not make sense in case of a storeless statistic.
This means a user can accidentially use a storeless statistic in a wrong way:



        Mean mean = new Mean();

        

        mean.increment(1);

        mean.increment(2);

        

        mean.setData(new double[] { 1, 2, 3});

        

        System.out.println(mean.getResult());

        System.out.println(mean.evaluate());



will output

1.5

2.0
