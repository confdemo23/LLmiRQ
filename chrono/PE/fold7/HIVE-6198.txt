ORC file and struct column names are case sensitive
HiveQL document states that the "Table names and column names are case insensitive". But the struct behavior for ORC file is different. 
Consider a sample text file:



$ cat data.txt

line1|key11:value11,key12:value12,key13:value13|a,b,c|one,two

line2|key21:value21,key22:value22,key23:value23|d,e,f|three,four

line3|key31:value31,key32:value32,key33:value33|g,h,i|five,six



Creating a table stored as txt and then using this to create a table stored as orc 



CREATE TABLE orig (

  str STRING,

  mp  MAP&lt;STRING,STRING&gt;,

  lst ARRAY&lt;STRING&gt;,

  strct STRUCT&lt;A:STRING,B:STRING&gt;

) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED

    FIELDS TERMINATED BY &amp;apos;|&amp;apos;

    COLLECTION ITEMS TERMINATED BY &amp;apos;,&amp;apos;

    MAP KEYS TERMINATED BY &amp;apos;:&amp;apos;;

LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH &amp;apos;data.txt&amp;apos; INTO TABLE orig;



CREATE TABLE tableorc (

  str STRING,

  mp  MAP&lt;STRING,STRING&gt;,

  lst ARRAY&lt;STRING&gt;,

  strct STRUCT&lt;A:STRING,B:STRING&gt;

) STORED AS ORC;

INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE tableorc SELECT * FROM orig;



Suppose we project columns or read the strct columns for both table types, here are the results. I have also tested the same with RC. The behavior is similar to txt files.



hive&gt; SELECT * FROM orig;

line1   {"key11":"value11","key12":"value12","key13":"value13"} ["a","b","c"]  

{"a":"one","b":"two"}

line2   {"key21":"value21","key22":"value22","key23":"value23"} ["d","e","f"]  

{"a":"three","b":"four"}

line3   {"key31":"value31","key32":"value32","key33":"value33"} ["g","h","i"]  

{"a":"five","b":"six"}

hive&gt; SELECT * FROM tableorc;

line1   {"key12":"value12","key11":"value11","key13":"value13"} ["a","b","c"]  

{"A":"one","B":"two"}

line2   {"key21":"value21","key23":"value23","key22":"value22"} ["d","e","f"]  

{"A":"three","B":"four"}

line3   {"key33":"value33","key31":"value31","key32":"value32"} ["g","h","i"]  

{"A":"five","B":"six"}

Time taken: 0.178 seconds, Fetched: 3 row(s)



hive&gt; SELECT strct FROM tableorc;

{"a":"one","b":"two"}

{"a":"three","b":"four"}

{"a":"five","b":"six"}



hive&gt;SELECT strct.A FROM orig;

one

three

five



hive&gt;SELECT strct.a FROM orig;

one

three

five



hive&gt;SELECT strct.A FROM tableorc;

one

three

five



hive&gt;SELECT strct.a FROM tableorc;

So it seems that ORC behaves differently for struct columns. Also why are we storing the column names for struct for the other types as CASE SENSITIVE? What is the standard for Hive QL with respect to structs?
