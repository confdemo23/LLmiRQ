DescriptiveStatistics.windowSize has a getter and setter, but is protected, so subclasses can bypass the validation check in the setter
DescriptiveStatistics.windowSize has a setter which does validation and maintains the list if necessary.
However the field is protected, so classes can ignore the setter.
As it happens, this is exactly what the subclass ListUnivariateImpl.setWindowSize does.
The field should be made private.
