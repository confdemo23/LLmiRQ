camel-netty-http - Checking for host header is invalid
See
http://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/Camel-Netty-Http-HttpHeaders-case-sensitive-tp5763157.html
The names() should be removed as it transfers the headers to a linked hash map instead of checking directly using the netty http headers which is case insensitive.
