ModelControllerClientOperationHandler doesn&apos;t manage the clientRequestExecutor properly 
ModelControllerClientOperationHandler&amp;apos;s constructor creates a ThreadPoolExecutor for handling client requests and then the class doesn&amp;apos;t clean it up.
In addition, an instance of ModelControllerClientOperationHandler is created per channel, not one per ModelControllerClientOperationHandlerFactoryService. I know I at least thought of the thread pool as being per remote management interface, not per channel.
Making it be per ModelControllerClientOperationHandlerFactoryService and cleaning it up in that service&amp;apos;s stop would be the easiest fix, but the pool settings may not be appropriate if we do that, so tread carefully.
