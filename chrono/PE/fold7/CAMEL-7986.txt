Route disappears with routeId set to "route1"
With below route configuration with routeId defined as route1, route2 and intentionally omitted routeId for the 3rd route, Camel will auto-generate a routeId with format as route + count for you if you didn&amp;apos;t define it. This seems to cause some routes to be missed.
Route definitions:



 from("direct:start1")

     .routeId("route1")

     .log("route1: ${body}");



 from("direct:start2")

      .routeId("route2")

      .log("route2: ${body}");



 from("direct:start3") // no route id!

      .log("route3: ${body}");



Testing:



 ProducerTemplate template = context.createProducerTemplate();

 template.sendBody("direct:start1", "World!");

 template.sendBody("direct:start2", "World!");



This leads to following exception:

    Caused by: org.apache.camel.component.direct.DirectConsumerNotAvailableException: No consumers available on endpoint: Endpoint[direct://start1]
If the direct:start3 route is deleted or the ID "route1" is renamed, then everything works as expected.
