Hazelcast seda documentation is misleading about pollInterval
Actual documentation says about property pollInterval used by hazelcast seda consumer: "How frequent to poll from the SEDA queue". Unfortunately this is wrong since pollInterval is used as blocking timeout while polling a Java BlockingQueue (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/BlockingQueue.html#poll%28long,%20java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit%29) which might lead to wrong usage. Property might considered to be renamed to e.g. blockingTimeout.
