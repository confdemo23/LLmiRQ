OLSMultipleLinearRegression STILL needs a way to specify non-zero singularity threshold when instantiating QRDecomposition
A fix was made for this issue in MATH-1110 for the newSampleData method but not for the newXSampleData method.
It&amp;apos;s a simple change to propagate the threshold to QRDecomposition:
237c237
&lt;         qr = new QRDecomposition(getX());

&gt;         qr = new QRDecomposition(getX(), threshold);
