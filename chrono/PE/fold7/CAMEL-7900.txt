hdfs2 - chunkSize not honored
camel-hdfs2 component exposes chunkSize param, but that value is not correctly used in 
https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/components/camel-hdfs2/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/component/hdfs2/HdfsFileType.java#L79
and the constant value:



public static final int DEFAULT_BUFFERSIZE = 4096;



always overrides it.
