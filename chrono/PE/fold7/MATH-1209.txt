Documentation in PoissonDistribution.sample() has dead link
The link in the javadoc at http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/apidocs/org/apache/commons/math3/distribution/PoissonDistribution.html for the sample() method points to http://irmi.epfl.ch/cmos/Pmmi/interactive/rng7.htm.  This link is dead.  I found it on the internet archive at https://web.archive.org/web/20090909055517/http://irmi.epfl.ch/cmos/Pmmi/interactive/rng7.htm.  The documentation should be updated or maybe Apache should mirror the page.
