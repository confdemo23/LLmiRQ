Classloader leak in JBossCachedAuthenticationManager
When using a security domain with cache-type="default", then the ModuleClassLoader instances related to deployments leak through JBossCachedAuthenticationManager.
The problematic piece of code is the domainCache member variable which in the DomainInfo value holds a LoginContext instance. This LoginContext has member contextClassLoader which causes the leak. (It points to the ModuleClassLoader of the deployment).
One option to solve this issue could be to remove the cache entries which are related to the undeployed application.
