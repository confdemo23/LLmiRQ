Very Slow performance for larger JSF 2 pages.
Very slow page performance using JSF 2 and Wildfly 8.2.0 for larger pages.  I am migrating a large application from JBoss AS 7.1.1 to Wildfly 8.2.0 and page performance on loads and posts is very slow.  I created a large JSF 2 test page and took timings for JBoss 7.1.1, Wildfly 8.2.0 and Tomcat 7.x using the same Mojarra 2.2.8 implementation as Wildfly.  
The attached war file contains mojarra 2.2.8 jars for tomcat.  The attached ear file is for JBoss deployments and does not contain mojarra jars.  
Example test URL for attached ear and war.
