dumpRoutesAsXml should resolve "from" endpoint property values as with "to" endpoint URI
We have defined our routes with property keys for all endpoints ("from" and "to"). When using the dumpRoutesAsXml operation we see that the "from uri" value is the property key, however the "to uri" has been resolved to the actual property value. 
For example, given a RouteBuilder like the following:



        from("{{route1.uri}}")

            .routeId("myRoute")

            .to("{{route2.uri}}")



dumpRoutesAsXml outputs the following:



    &lt;route customId="true" id="myRoute"&gt;

        &lt;from uri="{{route1.uri}}"/&gt;

        &lt;to uri="jms:myapp.route2" id="to2"/&gt;

    &lt;/route&gt;



where "myapp.route2" is the resolved value of "route2.uri".
Perhaps there is a good reason for this behaviour, but it appears to be inconsistent.
