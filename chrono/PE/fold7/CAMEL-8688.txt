Removed StreamCache when doing a Wiretap
Hi,
I noticed a bug where the body (StreamCache) was already removed before the exchange reached the end (in the Wiretap route).
I added a test as an attachment.
f you run the test you can clearly see the temp file deletion followed by the closed stream exception:
Tried 1 to delete file: /var/folders/db/brq60fqj4vb8mnx_5nlz36nw0000gn/T/camel/camel-tmp-00cd1ce2-7d44-47fe-b357-008e8146f770/cos8797132745923044996.tmp with result: true
Cannot reset stream from file /var/folders/db/brq60fqj4vb8mnx_5nlz36nw0000gn/T/camel/camel-tmp-00cd1ce2-7d44-47fe-b357-008e8146f770/cos8797132745923044996.tmp
I encountered the same issue during a more complex route that does some splitting (zip file) and multicasting. This occurred on Camel 2.14.1 so it could be fixed by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-8284 but I need to test this.
Kind regards,
Geert
