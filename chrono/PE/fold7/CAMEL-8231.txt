StompEndPoint does not throw exceptions in case of the underlying connection broken at the time of sending a message
At the time of  sending the message if the message broker (Apollo is used in this case) is down then no exception is raised from the send method of StompEndpoint.  The underlying connection (stomp jms connection) has the error caught and handled. Since the Stompendpoint does not use the CallBack to get notified of the underlying issue, the message sending is assumed successful.
