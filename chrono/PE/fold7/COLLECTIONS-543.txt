AbstractCollectionDecorator should not delegate equals and hashcode
In order to preserve the symmetry of equals the AbstractCollectionDecorator shall not forward calls to equals and hashcode to the decorated collection.
The test for equality usually also includes a test for the specific interface, e.g. List, which the collection decorator does not implement.
The relevant sub-classes like AbstractListDecorator can delegate the calls to safely fulfill the Collections contract.
