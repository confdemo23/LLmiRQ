CharSet.getInstance documentation does not clearly explain how to include negation character in set
As discussed in this Stack Overflow question, the documentation for CharSet.getInstance() don&amp;apos;t explain clearly how to include the negation character (^) as a literal character.
The two solutions suggested in the SO question are:



// Add the &amp;apos;^&amp;apos; on its own

CharSet.getInstance("^", "otherlettershere");



// Add the &amp;apos;^&amp;apos; as the last character

CharSet.getInstance("otherlettershere^")



If those are the best options, we should add a line to the Javadoc to indicate this. If there is a better way, clearly that should be documented instead.
