Kafka producer: partition key is optional, not required by kafka client api
In order to send to kafka, one need to construct KeyedMessage. 

 

    public KeyedMessage(String topic, K key, Object partKey, V message) {

        this.topic = topic;

        this.key = key;

        this.partKey = partKey;

        this.message = message;

        class.$init$(this);

        if(topic == null) {

            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Topic cannot be null.");

        }

    }



    public KeyedMessage(String topic, V message) {

        Object var10002 = null;

        Object var10003 = null;

        this(topic, (Object)null, (Object)null, message);

    }



    public KeyedMessage(String topic, K key, V message) {



Looks like only topic is required parameter, but partition key is optional. Also, if key is provided by the user I think is makes sense to propagate it.
