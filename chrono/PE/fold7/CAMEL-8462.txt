HttpServerChannelHandler should not store the instance of HttpRequest
HttpServerChannelHandler is created per NettyHttpConsumer, we should not store the Request instance in it&amp;apos;s field. 
BTW, we can alway access the Request Object from the MessageEvent or Context Object from the NettyHttpHandler.
