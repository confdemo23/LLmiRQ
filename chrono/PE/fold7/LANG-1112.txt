MultilineRecursiveToStringStyle largely unusable due to being package-private
The new MultilineRecursiveToStringStyle which was added under LANG-1052 is a package-private scoped class (no specific scope is specified for the class). I&amp;apos;m assuming, like RecursiveToStringStyle, it should be public instead?
