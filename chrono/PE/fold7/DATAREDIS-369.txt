RedisCache zset leak
I&amp;apos;m using the spring-data-redis caching abstraction support feature, and I&amp;apos;ve run into a serious redis leak. 
RedisCache maintains a "~keys" ZSET in redis that collects the keys for a logical cache (i.e. person~keys for a cache named person). When using expirations, the actual key expires fine, and I see code setting a TTL on the ZSET at the same time as the TTL for the real key, but that TTL applies to the entire set. If you have constant cache puts for new items into the same cache, the ZSET never expires and just grows unbounded. In a production scenario with a cache that has a TTL of 5 minutes, I&amp;apos;ve seen 2.9 million keys in the ZSET for the cache with hardly any of those keys actually still valid.
