SimpleMongoRepository.findById(id, class)  don&apos;t return ids for nested documents.
SimpleMongoRepository.findById(id, class)  don&amp;apos;t return ids for nested documents.
E.g. 






class A {




 private String id; //stored in mongo as "id"




 private String name;




}









class B {




  private String id; // stored in mongo as "_id"




  private List&lt;A&gt; innerDocs;




}






When it return B documents, innerDocs A objects have id == null. If i refactor A.id to A.myId, then it start working correctly.
Saving data (save, updateFirst, etc) always save fields correctly.
A and B objects are pojos (only lombok @Data and @NoArgsConstructor is used to provide getters and setters). Ids are created by mongo.
Could it related somehow  to ids that have 24 characters, but stored not as "_id"?
Easy workaround is to have different field name (not "id").
