Camel won&apos;t build on windows (camel-box and camel-api-component-maven-plugin)
Building camel fails on windows with the error: 
Failed to execute goal org.apache.camel:camel-api-component-maven-plugin:2.15-SNAPSHOT:fromApis (generate-test-component-classes) on project camel-box: Error generating source for com.box.boxjavalibv2.resourcemanagers.IBoxCollaborationsManager: String index out of range: 1
This is due to the plugin not escaping the windows file separator before using it in a regex.
