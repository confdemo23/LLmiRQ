When configuring CacheServer with a Disk Store (used for client subscription queue overflow), the Cache Server fails to start up with an error.
When configuring CacheServer with a Disk Store (used for client subscription queue overflow), the Cache Server fails to start up with the following error:






2013-11-07 07:54:20,034 [main] ERROR com.gopivotal.rti.boot.spring.AbstractXmlSpringInitializer -  




    Could not start Spring Container from resources [classpath:/spring/distgrid-context.xml]




org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: Error creating bean with name &amp;apos;DistGridCacheServer&amp;apos;: 




    Invocation of init method failed; nested exception is java.io.FileNotFoundException: 




    class path resource [DEFAULT] cannot be resolved to URL because it does not exist






I&amp;apos;ve tried changing the placement of the DiskStore and CacheServer elements in different positions, but the result is the same.  The bottom-line is that the CacheServer&amp;apos;s disk-store attribute needs the referenced DiskStore to be instantiated first.
