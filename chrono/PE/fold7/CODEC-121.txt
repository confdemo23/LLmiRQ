QuotedPrintableCodec does not support soft line break per the &apos;quoted-printable&apos; example on Wikipedia
Writing a unit test I discovered that the example Wikipedia uses for quoted-printable data does not decode but instead throws an exception.  
Their example is here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quoted-printable#Example
test:
  String qpdata   = "If you believe that truth=3Dbeauty, then surely=20=\r\n" +
		    "mathematics is the most beautiful branch of philosophy.";
  String expected = "If you believe that truth=beauty, then surely " +
		    "mathematics is the most beautiful branch of philosophy.";
  assertEquals( expected,  new QuotedPrintableCodec().decode(qpdata) );
I suppose I could fix if you like but currently I&amp;apos;m not a registered developer.
