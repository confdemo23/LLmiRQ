PropertyInject gives NullPointerException
Using the annotation @PropertyInject on a field of the RouteBuilder class gives a NullPointerException
public class RouteBuilder extends SpringRouteBuilder 
{

	

	@PropertyInject("foo.bar")

	private String fooBar;

        ...

}

Using the {{ }} notation in endpoint URIs is working though.
