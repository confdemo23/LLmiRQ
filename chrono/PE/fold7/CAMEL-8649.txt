Camel RAW() cannot handle String of  %2050



file:inbox?fileName=data+.txt (expected "inbox/data .txt" and result is OK)

file:inbox?fileName=data%20.txt (expected "inbox/data .txt" and result is OK)

file:inbox?fileName=RAW(data+.txt) (expected "inbox/data+.txt" and result is OK)

file:inbox?fileName=RAW(data%20.txt) (expected "inbox/data%20.txt", but actually it&amp;apos;s "inbox/data .txt") - I think it&amp;apos;s WRONG (disobeyed RAW)

file:inbox?fileName=RAW(data%2520.txt) (expected "inbox/data%2520.txt", but actually it&amp;apos;s also "inbox/data .txt") - I think it&amp;apos;s WRONG (disobeyed RAW + double URL decode)

Additional info:

RAW(data%252520.txt) results in "data%20.txt" (disobeyed RAW + double URL decode - it means there is not triple URL decode in this case)

RAW(data%2B.txt) results in "data+.txt" (disobeyed RAW + single URL decode - it means there is not double URL decode in this case)

data%252B.txt results in "data%2B.txt" (single URL decode - it means there is not double URL decode in this case)
