Simple language does not resolve overloaded method calls
I am having an issue with the Simple language. I have a property named myFile with a value of a java.nio.file.Path object. When I try to use the following expression 

 ${property.file.getFileName} 

 in order to invoke the getFileName() method I get an exception saying:

Ambiguous method invocations possible: [public sun.nio.fs.UnixPath.getFileName(), public abstract java.nio.file.Path java.nio.file.Path.getFileName()]



I am able to use SpEL if I do

#{properties[myFile].getFileName()}



It would be nice if Simple supported this as well so I wouldn&amp;apos;t have to go through hoops in order to use SpEL since I can&amp;apos;t use SpEL to specify parameters in a uri.
