JsonPathEngine skips file encoding
This occurs if one uses the camel file component with a charset parameter, e.g. file:/url?charset=UTF-8. It leads to strange effects:

testing the same utf8-file under linux (default encoding:UTF-8) and german windows (default encoding:windows-1252) leads to problems with german umlauts.
using a file in another encoding than the default (ISO-8859-1 on linux) leads also to problems with german umlauts.


Both problems can be reproduced with the attached unit test files in 2.14.1.
Problem 1 is hidden in 2.15-SNAPSHOT, because UTF-8 is hard-coded as file encoding (maybe ok, since JSON is almost never used with language specific encondings), Problem 2 also occurs in 2.15-SNAPSHOT

I can provide or help with a fix (or pull request), if these problems are classified as true defects.
