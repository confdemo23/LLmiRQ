Bug in HW rule in Soundex
The Soundex algorithm says that if two characters that map to the same code are separated by H or W, the second one is not encoded.
However, in the implementation (in Soundex.getMappingCode() line 191), a character that is preceded by two characters that are either H or W, is not encoded, regardless of what the last consonant was.
