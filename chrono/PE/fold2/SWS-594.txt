SchemaCollection issue when XSD files are in the classpath, in different JAR artifacts
Problem described in issue SWS-413 has partially been fixed.
Given XSD-A importing XSD-B, both in the classpath, the fix works if XSD-A and XSD-B are in the same classpath location (both in WEB-INF/classes, or in the same JAR file), but it does not work if the XSD files are located in different JAR files, for example.
The provided patch fixes this : if the imported XSD could not be resolved with the same base URI, we must keep searching in the classpath, (last statements should not be in an else block).
