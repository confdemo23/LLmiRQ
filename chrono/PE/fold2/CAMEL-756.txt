AMQP component can&apos;t send an ObjectMessage
Sending a TextMessage and BytesMessage work fine but when you try to send a Serializable object it gets lost somehow... see the testJmsRouteWithObjectMessage test in http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/activemq/camel/trunk/components/camel-amqp/src/test/java/org/apache/camel/component/amqp/AMQPRouteTest.java to see what happens.
