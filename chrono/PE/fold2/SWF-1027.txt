FilenameFlowUrlHandler does not implement createFlowDefinitionUrl
FilenameFlowUrlHandler, which was introduced in 2.0.4, extracts the flow id from an http request. However, it fails to construct the correct URL given the flow id. I think this should be implemented by overriding createFlowDefinitionUrl.
Test case:
1) configure a flow executor repository with max-executions="1"
2) Start a flow "X". 
3) Now start another flow "Y" by navigating to the URL of the "Y" flow. 
4) Press back on the browser. If the createFlowDefinitionUrl method works correctly then the system should take you to the beginning of a new flow "X".
