Get-s can&apos;t set a Filter
This is an issue directly related to HBASE-1646. Get#write and Get#readFields both use  HbaseObjectWritable to write filters and when it comes to custom filters or filters in general that are not hardcoded in HbaseObjectWritable , an exception is thrown. 
It has been fixed in the issue noted above for Scan. Attached patch fixes it fot Get too.
