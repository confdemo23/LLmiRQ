Listener Annotations don&apos;t allow parameters to be subtypes of expected types
Listener Annotations don&amp;apos;t allow parameters to be subtypes of expected types.  For example, consider the AfterProcess method.  Its enum value in StepListenerMetaData is defined as: 
AFTER_PROCESS("afterProcess", "after-process-method", AfterProcess.class, ItemProcessListener.class, Object.class, Object.class).
showing that it expects two Objects as parameters.  However, if the method is defined with subtypes of Object as its parameters, then an error is shown indicating the the signature is incompatible with what is expected:
@AfterProcess
public void afterProcess(String item, String result){ }
