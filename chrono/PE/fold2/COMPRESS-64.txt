Are the public finish() methods ArchiveOutputStream implementations necessary and safe?
Some of the ArchiveOutputStream implementations have public finish() methods. These are currently only called from the close() methods.
Seems to me that there is no need to allow the finish() methods to be called externally, and the user can corrupt the output if they do.
Surely the close() method is all that is needed?
