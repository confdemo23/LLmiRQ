{ssha} is specified in the Spring Security password-encoder schema, but isn&apos;t handled by code
Pretty minor, but I noticed that the 
{ssha}
 option for LDAP SSHA is an allowable value in the schema for password-encoder&amp;apos;s hash attribute, but it isn&amp;apos;t handled by PasswordEncoderParser.
