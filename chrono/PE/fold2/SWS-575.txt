CommonsXsdSchemaCollection: Combination of xs:includes and xs:imports in a schema result in incorrect/overcomplete schema in wsdl generated by DefaultWsdl11Definition
When using a DefaultWsdl11Definition for wsdl generation I used a CommonsXsdSchemaCollection to combine a set of xsd&amp;apos;s. I found out that when a schema uses a mix of xs:imports and xs:includes, the inline schema in the generated wsdl (inside &lt;wsdl:types&gt;) contains an error. Both xs:imports and xs:includes are &amp;apos;expanded&amp;apos; inline in the generated wsdl, but the xs:include lines are not removed from the inline schema, causing test tools like SOAPUI to fail (included schema&amp;apos;s cannot be retrieved).
