Support for @DirtiesContext at the test class level
Expected behavior:
  Context should be close()&amp;apos;d after end of test class execution
Observed behavior:
  Context only closed when @DirtiesContext annotates method
Multiple test classes can re-use the same context, which allows for faster test execution, so automatically closing a context after test class execution is probably not the best mechanism.  
However, there should be a way to annotate that a context should be close()&amp;apos;d after all tests in a test class are executed. 
Suggested fix:

allow @DirtiesContext to annotate class
add TestExecutionListener#destroyTestInstance

Willing to implementing, if given approval of design.
