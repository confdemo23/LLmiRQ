php thrift&apos;s getRow() would throw an exception if the row does not exist
I&amp;apos;ve been played with thrift recently, and observed an unexpected behavior: when getRow() encounters an non-existent row key, it throws an exception like this:
PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught exception &amp;apos;Exception&amp;apos; with message &amp;apos;getRow failed: unknown result&amp;apos; in pear/thrift/packages/Hbase/Hbase.php:715
Stack trace:
#0 pear/thrift/packages/Hbase/Hbase.php(666): HbaseClient-&gt;recv_getRow()
#1 htdocs/hbase/DemoClient.php(174): HbaseClient-&gt;getRow(&amp;apos;demo_table&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;00100-XXXX&amp;apos;)
#2 
{main}
 thrown in pear/thrift/packages/Hbase/Hbase.php on line 715
I would expect when we pass a non-existent key, it can throw something like NotFound (as in scanner) or one can test with RowResult.isEmpty() just like in java api.
