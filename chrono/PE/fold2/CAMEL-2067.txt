Mail Component: Character "|" in recipient addresses causes failure
It looks like there is minor bug in regex used in MailBinding.java, it causes "|" to act as delimiter, splitting email address into 2 parts.  
For ex: Using email address as - first|last@test.com causes it to split into two parts:
1) first
2) last@test.com
"|" is acceptable character in email as per wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address. I did not bother to read RFC specification.
Here is snippet of code causing issue:
 private static void appendRecipientToMimeMessage(MimeMessage mimeMessage, String type, String recipient)
        throws MessagingException {
        // we support that multi recipient can be given as a string seperated by comma or semi colon
        String[] lines = recipient.split("[,|;]");
        for (String line : lines) {
Regex above should either be "[,;]" or ";|,"
Also, having email addresses separate out by , or ; seems to be issue as it can be part of name. ex: "firstName, I like comma &lt;first.last@test.com&gt;" is valid. Above code will still cause failure for such messages. Can camel support addresses as List/Array rather than comma delimited string?
