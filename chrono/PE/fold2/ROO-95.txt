Invalid package declaration for generated resources of classes in default package
For classes that reside in the default package, Roo generates source files that have a package declaration, but no package identifier.
Steps to reproduce:
create a class in the default package:
import org.springframework.roo.addon.tostring.RooToString;
@RooToString
public class Foo {
}
The generated file Bar_Roo_ToString.aj will contain a package declaration as such:
"package ;"
which is invalid. The package declaration should not be emitted if a class resides in the default package.
