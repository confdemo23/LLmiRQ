All inserts of JobId should be of Types.BIGINT
In JdbcJobInstanceDao the jobid is mapped to different sql types depending on which table it is inserted in.
Types.INTEGER is used in
JdbcJobInstanceDao .createJobInstance
JdbcJobExecutionDao.saveJobExecution
Types.BIGINT is used in
JdbcJobInstanceDao .insertParameter 
I&amp;apos;m not sure if this is causing the problems I am having at the moment (breaches of constraint JOB_INST_PARAMS_FK on Sybase), but as the underlying datatype in the DB is the same for all tables persisting the jobid, the java.sql.Types used should probably be the same as well.
Someone should probably look through all the Jdbc*Daos to make sure that the same Types.* is used for all IDs, seems most inserts use Types.INTEGER.
