Brent solver shouldn&apos;t need strict ordering of min, max and initial
The "solve(final UnivariateRealFunction f, final double min, final double max, final double initial)" function calls verifySequence() which enforces a strict ordering of min, max and initial parameters. I can&amp;apos;t see why that is necessary - the rest of solve() seems to be able to handle "initial == min" and "initial == min" cases just fine. In fact, the JavaDoc suggests setting initial to min when not known but that is not possible at the moment.
