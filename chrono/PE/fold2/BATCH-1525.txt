ExitStatus description can be null when re-hyrated from  Oracle
The equals implementation (or the toString) of ExitStatus may not work legitimately in all cases.
In Oracle, an empty String is considered as null and fails our build because we assert the exit status matched the expected (that is, a given exit code and an empty exit description). 
We got this
java.lang.AssertionError: expected:&lt;exitCode=COMPLETED WITH ERROR;exitDescription=&gt; but was:&lt;exitCode=COMPLETED WITH ERROR;exitDescription=null&gt;
It&amp;apos;s not a big deal and we can deal with that in our test utilities but if the equals supported that use case, that would be great since we don&amp;apos;t really want to put a &amp;apos;null&amp;apos; exit description. Besides the default constructor does this
public ExitStatus(String exitCode) {
   this(exitCode, "");
}
