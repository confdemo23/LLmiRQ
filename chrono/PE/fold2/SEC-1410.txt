Remember Me doesn&apos;t work with OpenID urls contatining "https://"
As of 3.0.1, AbstractRememberMeServices.decodeCookie() treats usernames with "http://" as a special case for compatibility with OpenID. But some OpenID providers use "https://..." in their identity urls, and cookies with such usernames are decoded incorrectly.
