MurmurHash does not yield the same results as the reference C++ implementation when size % 4 >= 2
Last rounds of MurmurHash are done in reverse order. data[length - 3], data[length - 2] and data[length - 1] in the block processing the remaining bytes should be data[len_m +2], data[len_m + 1], data[len_m].
