ChunkMonitor warning message about stream state is inaccurate
ChunkMonitor warning message about stream state is inaccurate: it warns the user if a multi-threaded access to ItemStream data is detected, and it checks for a null stream, but the stream is a composite and it is always null.  Should check for a registered stream inside the composite.
