MyFaces bugs causes FacesMessage serialization failure in a clustered environment
One of changes in webflow 2.07 causes the message context to be stored across redirects, unfortunately a current MyFaces bug (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MYFACES-1347) causes serialization failure when running in a clustered environment.
Since the MyFaces issue has been opened since 2006 here is a work around patch that could be applied to webflow.
As this is a MyFaces issue you might not want to apply the patch but I will post it here anyway in case anyone else hits the same issue.
