FlowJob.getStep() only looks at state names, not step names
FlowJob.getStep() only looks at state names, not step names, so anyone using the StepLocator interface is in for a surprise.  The state name happens to be the same as the step name in the existing uint tests (irony), but when created by the XML namespace parsers they are different.
