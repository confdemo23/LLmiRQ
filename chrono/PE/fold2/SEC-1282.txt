Possible Bug - UnanimousBased Incorrectly Grants When One Of The Votes Is An Absension
Overall Spring Security is AWESOME and you guys are doing a great job!
However, I am convinced I found either a bug or Doc error in UnanimousBased AccessDecisionManager.  
The API doc says "grants access if only grant votes were received" but I am certain I got it to grant access when one of the votes was an Abstention.
Or if this is not a bug, please clarify API to say 
"grants access if only grant or abstained votes were received"
Thanks so much and keep up the great work!!
Spring Security Rocks!
