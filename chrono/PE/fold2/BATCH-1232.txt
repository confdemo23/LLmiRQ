Sybase 12.5 compatiblity when writing to the spring batch context tables
In version 2.0.0, I am facing an error when persisting to the context tables (BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION_CONTEXT in specific) on the sybase version 12.5. The class JdbcExecutionContextDao shows that when the field SERIALIZED_CONTEXT is set to null, it is set with type 2005 (Types.CLOB). This type is not supported on sybase 12.5
