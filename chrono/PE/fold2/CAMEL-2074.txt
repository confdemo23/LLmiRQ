camel-bean - should skip getter/setter methods when looking for method candidates
If you have a POJO and you have a setter for a Camel concept such as a org.apache.camel.TypeConverter then the bean component could consider invoking the setTypeConverter method as a candidate.
In fact it should skip any getter/setter all together.
For example this pojo

public class RiderOrderService {

    private TypeConverter converter;

    public void setConverter(TypeConverter converter) {
        this.converter = converter;
    }

    public String handleCustom(GenericFile file) {
    ...
    }

    public String handleXML(Document doc) {
    ...
    }


Camel should only consider the 2 handle methods. The setter should be skipped.
