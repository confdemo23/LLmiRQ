Allow ScriptOperator to consume not all input data
The ScriptOperator (SELECT TRANSFORM(a, b, c) USING &amp;apos;myscript&amp;apos; AS (d, e, f) ...) has a problem:
If the user script exits without consuming all data from standard input, then we will report an error even if the exit code from the user script is 0.
We want to have an option, when enabled, ScriptOperator will return successfully in that case.
If the option is not enabled, then we should stick to the current behavior.
The option can be called: "hive.exec.script.allow.partial.consumption ".
