Puts are permitted (and stored) when including an appended colon
If I have a table with family "testFamily", currently I can do Puts using the new API by specifying the family name with or without a colon.  The KV is then stored w/ or w/o depending on how the Put was done.
If you try to Put.add("testFamily:", "qualifier", "value") this should throw a NoSuchColumnFamilyException
