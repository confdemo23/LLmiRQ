List of stepnames incomplete for nested flow job
The function  getStepNames on a job returns only those step names from a FlowJob, whose steps are defined directly within the flow.
But if the job contains nested flows the list of stepnames is incomplete. Only those of the outermost flow (the job itself) are returned but none of the nested flow(s).
If the job does only reference sub flows the list will be empty at all.
The function should return the complete list of steps, including nested flows within subflows (recursively)
