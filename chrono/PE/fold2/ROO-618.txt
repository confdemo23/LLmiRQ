AutoPopulationUtils fails to set @AutoPopulate fields with array value unless input annotation in array form
If I have a Roo-managed "Pizza" entity annotated thus:






@RooEntity






and I add this "finders" element to it:






@RooEntity(finders = "findPizzasByName")






then nothing happens in the Roo shell. It&amp;apos;s only when I add the curly braces like this:






@RooEntity(finders = {"findPizzasByName"})






that Roo creates the Pizza_Roo_Finder.aj file. Yet the compiler is happy without the braces, and all other annotations I&amp;apos;ve worked with are equally happy without the braces. Ben reckons this looks like a Roo bug.
