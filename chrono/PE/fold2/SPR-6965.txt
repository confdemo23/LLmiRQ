Sybase isn&apos;t detected by metadata when using WebLogic JDBC Driver
When trying to use Spring JDBC classes with Sybase through WebLogic JDBC driver, you get exception like "SQL Server is not one of the databases fully supported for procedure calls...".
Research shows that WebLogic driver returns "SQL Server" to "getDatabaseProductName" metadata call, unlike JConnect driver which returns "Sybase SQL Server". I also found corresponding issue CR120330 in documentation.
