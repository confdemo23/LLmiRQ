Validator only runs if signature matches exact model object Class
when writing a Validator component, (matching the conventions of name), the signature of the method must match exactly the command object type.
Let&amp;apos;s say my validation method is :
validateMyViewId(MyObject command, ValidationContext ctx) (...)
Then the validator will not run if command object is of type MyExtendedObject (extends MyObject)
This is a critical behaviour, in case the command object changes during the webflow, then validation won&amp;apos;t be run anymore.
(The match is done in ValidationHelper class)
