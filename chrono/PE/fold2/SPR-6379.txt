Import of XML resources with &apos;classpath*:&apos; URLs doesn&apos;t work
it&amp;apos;s probably related to SPR-5762.
I think, that the issue is in DefaultBeanDefinitionDocumentReader class. In 3.0.0.RC1 there was used call &amp;apos;ResourcePatternUtils.isUrl(location)&amp;apos;, in 3.0.0.RC2 it&amp;apos;s changed and I think, that it&amp;apos;s related to this correction. 
When the classes are unpacked, it leads to transformation of classpath* URL to file URL, which causes the problem.
Attach is simple test case, which works in 3.0.0.RC1, but fail on 3.0.0.RC2.
