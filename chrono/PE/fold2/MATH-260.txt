Inconsistent API in Frequency
The overloaded Frequency methods are not consistent in the parameter types that they handle.
addValue() has an Integer version which converts the parameter to a Long, and then calls addValue(Object).
The various getxxx() methods all handle Integer parameters as an Object.
Seems to me that it would be better to treat Integer consistently.
But perhaps there is a good reason for having an addValue(Integer) method but no getxxx(Integer) methods?
If so, then it would be helpful to document this.
