Spring WebFlow throws IllegalArgumentException while binding map entries
If I&amp;apos;m not wrong, since 2.0.7 org.springframework.webflow.mvc.view.BindingModel implements org.springframework.validation.BindingResult. This affects behavior when binding properties of java.util.Map type.
BindStatus(RequestContext requestContext, String path, boolean htmlEscape) is instantiated for field of java.util.Map type. As far as I could trace relevant execution, Spring tries to determine type of map entries, and since map is empty type ends up to be null which is not acceptable as parameter to ConversionExecutorPropertyEditor(ConversionService conversionService, Class fieldType, String converterId) constructor called from BindingModel findEditor(String field, Class valueType) method.
