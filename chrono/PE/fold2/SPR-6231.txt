RESTful URLs with path variables containing dots are incorrectly mapped
The change made in SPR-5537 effectively strips any file extension in GET requests in order to exclude it from the path variable value. Unfortunately, this prevents queries that contains dots as part of the path variable, i.e. an email address. Therefore the following request:
http://localhost:8080/rest/emailaddress/email/test%40mail.com
with the following controller request mapping:
@RequestMapping(value = "/email/
{email}
", method = RequestMethod.GET)
public ModelAndView getEmail(@PathVariable("email") final String email) {
}
will map the value "test@mail" to the variable email.
