Enhance or create LdapTemplate.authenticate methods to throw exception rather than simply returning "false".
The ldaptemplate.authenticate method swallows the AuthenticationException.
I realize that the AuthenticationException is logged, but I need to return this information to the caller so that they can seek remedy.
For example, if error is:
52e then user will know to re-enter password
530 then user will know to try later
532 then user will know password has expired
533 then user will know that account is disabled
etc....
Please make the ldaptemplate.authenticate throwable or somehow able to return the exception message along with FALSE.
Or create a new set of "authenticate" methods that throw the Exception.
