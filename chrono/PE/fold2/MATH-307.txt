BigReal/Fieldelement divide without setting a proper scale -> exception: no exact representable decimal result
BigReal implements the methode divide of Fieldelement. The problem is that there is no scale defined for the BigDecimal so the class will throw an error when the outcome is not a representable decimal result. 
(Exception: no exact representable decimal result)
The workaround for me was to copy the BigReal and set the scale and roundingMode the same as version 1.2.
Maybe is it possible to set the scale in FieldMatrix and implements it also a divide(BigReal b, int scale, int roundMode) ??
