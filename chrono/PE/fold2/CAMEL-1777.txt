The Exchange.BEAN_METHOD_NAME header is not be set rightly when the message exchange pattern is InOut
If the Bean endpoint has an explicit method name ,   the Bean processor will set the message header of Exchange.Bean_METHOD_NAME with the value of method name  before the invocation and will try to reset the message header of Exchange.Bean_METHOD_NAME with the preview method name after the invocation. 
Current camel code just set the InMessage&amp;apos;s header , if the ExchangePatter is InOut , it forget to reset the OutMessage&amp;apos;s header.
