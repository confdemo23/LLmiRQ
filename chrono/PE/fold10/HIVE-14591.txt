HS2 is shut down unexpectedly during the startup time
If there is issue with Zookeeper (e.g. connection issues), then it takes HS2 some time to connect. During this time, Ambari could issue health checks against HS2 and the CloseSession call will trigger the shutdown of HS2, which is not expected. That triggering should happen only when the HS2 has been deregistered with Zookeeper, not during the startup time when HS2 is not registered with ZK yet.
