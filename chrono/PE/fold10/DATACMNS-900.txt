ExampleMatcher.PropertySpecifiers does not implement equals/hashCode
The class ExampleMatcher.PropertySpecifiers does not implement equals/hashCode. Since an ExampleMatcher and its PropertySpecifiers are referenced by an Example instance, this means that it is not possible to mock the implementation of repository methods taking an Example as argument, e.g. JpaRepository.findAll(Example).
