Can&apos;t get underlying PostgreSQL database connection from datasource
I need to get the underlying PostgreSQL database connection from a datasource, see "Steps to Reproduce" for how exactly I&amp;apos;m trying to achieve this. In Wildfly Swarm this results in a ClassNotFoundException. I have also tried this with Wildfly 10 and there it does work.
