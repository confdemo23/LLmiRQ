Add the metrics of replication sources which were transformed from other dead rs to ReplicationLoad



  private void buildReplicationLoad() {

    // get source

    List&lt;ReplicationSourceInterface&gt; sources = this.replicationManager.getSources();

    List&lt;MetricsSource&gt; sourceMetricsList = new ArrayList&lt;MetricsSource&gt;();



    for (ReplicationSourceInterface source : sources) {

      if (source instanceof ReplicationSource) {

        sourceMetricsList.add(((ReplicationSource) source).getSourceMetrics());

      }

    }



    // get sink

    MetricsSink sinkMetrics = this.replicationSink.getSinkMetrics();

    this.replicationLoad.buildReplicationLoad(sourceMetricsList, sinkMetrics);

  }



The buildReplicationLoad method in o.a.h.h.r.r.Replication didn&amp;apos;t consider the replication source which were transformed from other died rs.
