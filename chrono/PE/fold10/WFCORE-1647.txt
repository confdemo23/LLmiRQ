Default app-name value of Syslog handler in Audit Logging violates specification
According to syslog specification[1] app-name cannot contain space character (" "). However, the default value in WildFly Core 3.0.0.Alpha3 is WildFly Core. This results in the syslog server is not able to capture Process ID from which the message was sent.
E.g. following piece of information is captured WildFly[Core] (...) instead of WildFlyCore[795]
Suggestions for improvement:
Change default value WildFly Core to one without space character.
Also please consider addition of check whether app-name contains space character.
