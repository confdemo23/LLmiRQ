Acid clashes with ConfVars.HIVEFETCHTASKCONVERSION <> "none"
Some queries are optimized so as not to create an MR job. This somehow causes the Configuration object in FetchOperator to be passed to the operator before Driver.recordValidTxns() is called. So then to this op it looks like there are no valid txns and it returns nothing.
