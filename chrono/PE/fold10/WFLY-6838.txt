RPCs to non-existant FORK channel are dropped
RPCs sent to a FORK channel that is not currently running are not responded to correctly, causing the caller to eventually time out.
An error response is being sent by org.jboss.as.clustering.jgroups.JChannelFactory, but the request ID is hard-coded to 0 so the reply can not be routed back to the sender and gets dropped.
