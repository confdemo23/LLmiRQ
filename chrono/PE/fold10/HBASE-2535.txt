split hostname format should be consistent with tasktracker for locality
I was running a mapreduce job (via Hive) against HBase, and noticed that I wasn&amp;apos;t getting any locality (the input split location and the task tracker machine in the job tracker UI were always different, and "Rack-local map tasks" in the job counters was 0).
I tracked this down to a discrepancy in the way hostnames were being compared.
The task tracker detail had a Host like
/f/s/1.2.3.4/h.s.f.com.
(with trailing dot)
But the Input Split Location had
/f/s/1.2.3.4/h.s.f.com
(without trailing dot)
