Make RPC server inside Hive on Spark port range configuration 
Currently the RPC server inside the hive on spark binds to a random port, which causes the issue in production environment that firewall is enabled and certain ports are enabled. Make the range configurable so the admin can control it. 

 .option(ChannelOption.SO_BACKLOG, 1)

      .option(ChannelOption.SO_REUSEADDR, true)

      .childOption(ChannelOption.SO_KEEPALIVE, true)

      .bind(0)

      .sync()

      .channel();
