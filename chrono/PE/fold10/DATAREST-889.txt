JSON Patch silently nullifies property values
The current JSON patch implementation internally catches exceptions (JsonLateObjectEvaluator line 41) and misses certain cases in if-else-statements (JsonPatchPatchConverter line 127), resulting in SDR setting the property value to null. This is quite bad, as already noticed in DATAREST-886. Instead some exception, like the PatchException should be thrown to avoid applying wrong changes.
