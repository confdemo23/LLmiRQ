Connection should be released when used with read-only transactions
A RedisTemplate with enabled transaction support does not close the connection when used in read-only transactions.






	@Transactional(readOnly = true)




	public void readonly() {




			template.opsForValue().set("key", "value");




	}






RedisTemplate.execute performs a check after the callback whether transaction support is enabled and if so, it skips connection releasing.
