nvl funtion not working after left outer join 
Recreating problem.
1).Create table with sample data.
create table tabletest (n bigint, t string); 
insert into tabletest values (1, &amp;apos;one&amp;apos;); 
insert into tabletest values(2, &amp;apos;two&amp;apos;); 
2) Run leftouter join query on single table.
select a.n as leftHandN 
, b.n as rightHandN 
, b.t as rightHandT 
, nvl(b.t,"empty") as rightHandTnvl  Expected empty --&gt; received empty
, nvl(b.n,-1) as rightHandNnvl  Expected -1 --&gt; received 1 
from 
(
select *
from tabletest 
where n=1
) a
left outer join
(
select *
from tabletest 
where 1=2
) b
on a.n = b.n;
nvl(b.n,-1) should return -1 but returns 1.
I have found b.n always returning a.n value.if a.n is 1 ,b.n is returning 1 and if it is 2,same 2 will be returned.
More information:
length(b.n) --gives--&gt;1
cast(b.n as string) -gives--&gt;1
ascii(b.n) -gives---&gt;49 i.e 1
