Trigger flush without waiting when compaction is disabled on a table
When compaction is disabled on a table, flush needs to wait MemStoreFlusher#blockingWaitTime (default value is 90 seconds) before it goes ahead to flush. It has side effect that client may be blocked due to RegionTooBusyException. Please see the mail sent to dev list.

I guess that the right behavior is to do flush without waiting if compaction is disabled on a table. Attached a patch.
