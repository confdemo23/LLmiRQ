Elytron properties-realm is not compatible with legacy user property files
When users properties file (e.g. mgmt-users.properties) used by legacy properties security realm is taken and used with Elytron properties-realm (backed by org.wildfly.security.auth.realm.LegacyPropertiesSecurityRealm) then there exist username/password combinations which do not works correctly.
Following scenarios which uses mentioned below username/password work correctly for properties file used by legacy solution and do not work for Elytron:






elytron:password                            // results to username elytron with password password




elytronumlaut=password                   // results to username elytronumlaut with password password




elytron=password                        // results to username elytron with password password




backslash\\=password                        // results to username backslash\ with password password




backslash\\inthemiddle=password             // results to username backslash\inthemiddle with password password




dn\=elytron,dc\=wildfly,dc\=org=password    // results to username dn=elytron,dc=wildfly,dc=org with password password




elytron1=pass=word                          // results to username elytron1 with password pass=word - covered by JBEAP-6581




elytron2=password\\                         // results to username elytron2 with password password\




elytron3=pass\\word                         // results to username elytron3 with password pass\word




elytron4=passwordWithumlaut              // results to username elytron4 with password passwordWithumlaut




elytron5=                               // results to username elytron5 with password 






Also &amp;apos;!&amp;apos; can be used for comments. It means that !elytron=password should not be considered as user !elytron but as comment.
