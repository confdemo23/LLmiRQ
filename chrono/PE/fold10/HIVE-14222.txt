PTF: Operator initialization does not clean state
PTFOperator::initializeOp() does not reset currentKeys to null.



      if (currentKeys != null &amp;&amp; !keysAreEqual) {

        ptfInvocation.finishPartition();

      }

....

      if (currentKeys == null) {

          currentKeys = newKeys.copyKey();

        } else {

          currentKeys.copyKey(newKeys);

        }
