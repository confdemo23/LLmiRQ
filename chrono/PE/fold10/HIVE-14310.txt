ORC schema evolution should not completely disable PPD
Follow up for HIVE-14214 which completely shuts off PPD when there is any schema evolution. Some evolutions are safer for PPD like
byte -&gt; short -&gt; int -&gt; long
float -&gt; double (This is unsafe, see comments in SchemaEvolution.java in the patch)
varchar &lt;-&gt; string (string to char, varchar to char and vice versa is also unsafe conversion as Orc stores internal index with padded spaces for char)
For all other conversions we can disable PPD for that specific column that has evolved by returning TruthValue.YES_NO
