JPA projection query returning single non-standard JPA type results in "No aliases found in result tuple" error
This relates directly to DATAJPA-885. The issue described there still occurs when a query returns a standard JPA projection consisting of a single type, where Spring Data JPA doesn&amp;apos;t recognize that the type can be mapped by the JPA provider itself. In my case this happens when returning a collection of Joda LocalDate instances. 
I&amp;apos;ve attached a small sample app with a unit test that shows the problem. The same test also shows that a direct JPA query does work.
It would be nice if Spring Data JPA could somehow detect that I&amp;apos;m not trying to use its projection feature in this case, to prevent the "No aliases found in result tuple" error from happening.
