Sync method in RecoverableZooKeeper failed to pass callback function in



public void sync(String path, AsyncCallback.VoidCallback cb, Object ctx) throws KeeperException {

    checkZk().sync(path, null, null); //callback function cb is not passed in

  }



It is obvious that the callback method is not passed in.  Since sync operation in Zookeeper is a &amp;apos;async&amp;apos; operation, we need a callback method to notify the caller that the &amp;apos;sync&amp;apos; operation is finished.
