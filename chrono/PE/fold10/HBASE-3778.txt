HBaseAdmin.create doesn&apos;t create empty boundary keys
In my ycsb stuff, I have code that looks like this:



    String startKey = "user1020000000";

    String endKey = "user940000000";

    admin.createTable(descriptor, startKey.getBytes(), endKey.getBytes(), regions);



The result, however, is a table where the first and last region has defined first and last keys rather than empty keys.
The patch I am about to attach fixes this, I think.  I have some worries about other uses of Bytes.split, however, and would like some eyes on this patch.  Perhaps we need a new dialect of split.
