Broken placeholder in exception message to be created in QueryByExamplePredicateBuilder.getPredicate()
Hi,
the class QueryByExamplePredicateBuilder has a bug in the getPredicates-Method. If it tries to throw a JpaSystemException the string formattier throws an UnknownFormatConversionException because of the missing "s" after the second "%" in the formatting template.






String.format("Unexpected path type for %s. Found % where From.class was expected.", currentPath, from)));






best regards,
Raphael
