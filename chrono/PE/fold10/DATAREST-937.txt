Transient properties in JSON should be included in merge
When using the repository domain object update end point (via the PATCH method with JSON data), fields that are not persisted (marked as @Transient or simply not marked for persistence) are not updated.
For example, given this class:






@JsonAutoDetect(fieldVisibility = Visibility.ANY)




static class SampleWithTransient {









	String name;




	@org.springframework.data.annotation.Transient String temporary;




}






if an HTTP PATCH is done to update that object with this request body:






{




  "temporary": "new temp"




}






the result will be that the value of temporary was not changed to "new temp" as expected.
