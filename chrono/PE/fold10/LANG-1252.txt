NumberUtils.isNumber and NumberUtils.createNumber resolve inconsistently
In considering the issues LANG-1060, LANG-1040, LANG-1038, and LANG-992, it seems that there are times when NumberUtils.isNumber resolves to false while NumberUtils.createNumber, given the same input, does not throw an exception, returning a valid java.lang.Number. This inconsistency should be resolved either by making isNumber more lenient or createNumber more stringent.
