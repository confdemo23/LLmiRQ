BeanInfo#introspect does not work correctly with bridge methods
Instead of selecting implementation method, bridge method is used. We faced an issue with conversion of parameter when bean implements generic interface.
For example having bean implementation like this:



    public interface Service&lt;R&gt; {



        int process(R request);

    }



    public static class MyService implements Service&lt;Request&gt; {



        public int process(Request request) {

            return request.x + 1;

        }

    }



would lead to beanInfo containing Method with signature 



public abstract int process(Object request)



in methodMap
This is not correct as conversion of parameter is not possible in this case.
I could find an issue with the same problem that was previously fixed (CAMEL-8940), but later on it was broken with CAMEL-9656 (commit 5639b78).
