"swarm.port.offset" not working
The system property "swarm.port.offset" doesn&amp;apos;t work for now.
I found port-offset value is hard-coded with zero in DefaultSocketBindingGroupProducer.
https://github.com/wildfly-swarm/wildfly-swarm/blob/master/container/src/main/java/org/wildfly/swarm/container/runtime/config/DefaultSocketBindingGroupProducer.java#L35
It should be passed the system prop like this.






new SocketBindingGroup(




                "standard-sockets",




                "public",




                SwarmProperties.propertyVar(SwarmProperties.PORT_OFFSET, "0"))






I&amp;apos;ll send a p-r later.
