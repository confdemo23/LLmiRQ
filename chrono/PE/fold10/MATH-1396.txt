Overflows in "UniformIntegerDistribution"
In o.a.c.m.distribution.UniformIntegerDistribution, several methods will compute an invalid result when the lower and upper bounds are such that

upper - lower



overflows.
Affected methods:

probability
cumulativeProbability
getNumericalVariance

Method

getNumericalMean

will return an invalid result when

upper + lower



overflows.
A possible fix is to define instances variables

upperPlusLower = (double) upper + (double) lower;

upperMinusLower = (double) upper - (double) lower;



and use them instead of the respective integer operations in the above methods.
