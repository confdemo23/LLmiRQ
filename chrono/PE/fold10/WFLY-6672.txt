EJB&apos;s async methods&apos; Future#get should treat zero timeout as "don&apos;t wait"
Say there is an asynchronous EJB method:






@Asynchronous




public Future&lt;Boolean&gt; method() {




   ...




}






Calling Future#get with a zero timeout:






if (bean.method().get(0, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS))






results in a block until the task is finished.
Instead I expected zero waiting, because java.util.concurrent.Future.get(long, TimeUnit) doesn&amp;apos;t specify any special treatment for a zero timeout value.
