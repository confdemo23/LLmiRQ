RMI registry is not destroyed after stopping JMX Connector Server
We are creating RMI registry in JMXListener.startConnectorServer() ,



    // Create the RMI registry

    LocateRegistry.createRegistry(rmiRegistryPort);



This registry is never deregistered, should be destoyed after stopping JMX Connector server.
