ResultProcessor should create approximate collection instead of exact one
ResultProcessor currently tries to create an instance of the exact collection type encountered when processing collections. This will fail for special collection implementation types that don&amp;apos;t have a default constructor or fail to instantiate for other reasons.
We should fall back to an approximate collection in that case.
