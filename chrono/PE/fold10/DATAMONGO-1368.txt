findByIgnoreCase Not Escaping Parenthesis
This was tested on 1.7.0.RELEASE.
I have a method in the interface like:
Object findOneByIdAndNameIgnoreCase(String id, String name);
I call the function like this:
dao.findOneByIdAndNameIgnoreCase("uid", "Engineer (TX)");
This causes the following query to be generated (as seen in the debug log):
(MongoTemplate.java:2066) - findOne using query: { "id" : "uid" , "name" : { "$regex" : "^Engineer (TX)$" , "$options" : "i"}} in db.collection
Which fails to find the record having:
{

"id" : "uid",

"name" : "Engineer (TX)"

}

Because the regex sees the parenthesis as part of the regex (as a group matcher) when it should see them as part of the plaintext.  i.e. they are not being escaped.
