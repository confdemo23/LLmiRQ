query on view with CTE and alias fails with table not found error
HIVE-10698 fixed one issue of the query on view with CTE, but it seems to break another case if a alias is given for the CTE.

use bugtest;

create table basetb(id int, name string);

create view testv1 as

with subtb as (select id, name from bugtest.basetb)

select id from subtb a;

use castest;

explain select * from bugtest.testv1;

hive&gt; explain select * from bugtest.testv1;



FAILED: SemanticException Line 2:21 Table not found &amp;apos;subtb&amp;apos; in definition of VIEW testv1 [

with subtb as (select `basetb`.`id`, `basetb`.`name` from `bugtest`.`basetb`)

select `a`.`id` from `bugtest`.`subtb` `a`

] used as testv1 at Line 1:14
