After running static code analysis on common codecs we discovered that it leaks file descriptors. The relevant locations are:

DaitchMokotoffSoundex -&gt; the static initializer on line 229
Rule -&gt; the static initializer on line 212 and the parseRules() method on line 438.

patch provided via github pull request.
This issue is relevant for web app deployments on OSes (like windows) that lock the files if ther eare open streams to them, and will prevent application undeployment.
