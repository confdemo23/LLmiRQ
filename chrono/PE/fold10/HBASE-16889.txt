Proc-V2: verifyTables in the IntegrationTestDDLMasterFailover test after each table DDL is incorrect 
In the IntegrationTestDDLMasterFailover test, verifyTables is called after each table DDL.  It iterates 3 lists of tables in ConcurrentHashMap (enabledTables, disabledTables, deletedTables) and tries to do some verification.  This is incorrect, eg. a table in enabledTables map could be picked up by DeleteTableAction and is disabled, while the verification tries to check whether table is enabled.  This leads to false assertion.  
The same for verifyNamespaces().  
The proposed fix is to verify maps only at the end of tests (while no active DDL operation is going on).  During test run, we only verify the target table before putting into map.
