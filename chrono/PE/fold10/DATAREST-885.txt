Patch with object value omitted
After migrating to spring data rest 2.5.2 the PATCH operation with application/json-patch+json for object values is broken.
Consider the following entity:






@Entity




public class Product implements Identifiable&lt;Long&gt; {









    @Id




    @GeneratedValue(strategy = IDENTITY)




    private Long id;









    private String name;









    @Embedded




    private Gtin gtin;




}









@Embeddable




@Getter




@Setter




public class Gtin {









    private String type;




    private String value;




}






I try to patch with the following payload.






[




  {




    "op":"replace",




    "path":"/gtin",




    "value":{"type":"EAN","value":"some"}




  }




]






As a result of this operation the property to update (gtin) is null. 
org.springframework.data.rest.webmvc.json.patch.JsonLateObjectEvaluator#evaluate returns null because it receives a JsonMappingException as it tries to serialize the value json into the entity type.
