user and password supplied from URL is overwritten by the empty user and password of the JDBC connection string when it&apos;s calling from beeline
When we make the call beeline -u "jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000/;user=aaa;password=bbb", the user and password are overwritten by the blank ones since internally it constructs a "connect &lt;url&gt; &amp;apos;&amp;apos; &amp;apos;&amp;apos; &lt;driver&gt;" call with empty user and password.
