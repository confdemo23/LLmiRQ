Query ID is being reused across queries
Aihua Xu I see this commit made via HIVE-11488. I see that query id is being reused across queries. This defeats the purpose of a query id. I am not sure what the purpose of the change in that jira is but it breaks the assumption about a query id being unique for each query. Please take a look into this at the earliest.
