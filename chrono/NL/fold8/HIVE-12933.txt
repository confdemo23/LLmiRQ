Beeline will hang when authenticating with PAM when libjpam.so is missing
When we setup PAM authentication, we need to have libjpam.so under java.library.path. If it happens to misplace the .so file, rather than giving an exception, the client will hang forever.
Seems we should catch the exception when the lib is missing.
