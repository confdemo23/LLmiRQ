Sorted dynamic partition does not work if subset of partition columns are constant folded
If all partition columns are constant folded then sorted dynamic partitioning should not be used as it is similar to static partitioning. But if only subset of partition columns are constant folded sorted dynamic partition optimization will be helpful. Currently, this optimization is disabled if atleast one partition column constant folded.
