Rounding in Stats for equality expressions
Currently we divide numRows(long) by countDistinct(long), thus ignoring the decimals. We should do proper rounding.
This is specially useful for equality expressions over columns whose values are unique. As NDV estimates allow for a certain error, if countDistinct &gt; numRows, we end up with 0 rows in the estimate for the expression.
