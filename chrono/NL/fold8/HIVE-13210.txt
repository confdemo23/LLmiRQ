Revert changes in HIVE-12994 related to metastore
As we do not control what is written in the physical layer and thus we cannot ensure NULLS ORDER (and even if we did, currently we do not take advantage of it), it seems exposing the NULLS ORDER property at metastore level does not make much sense. We will revert that part of patch HIVE-12994.
