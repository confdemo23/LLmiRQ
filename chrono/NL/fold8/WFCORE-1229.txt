Reloading the embed host controller logs ERROR messages
Embed host controller sometime logs ERROR message while booting up after the reload (&amp;apos;reload --host=master --admin-only=true&amp;apos;).






ERROR [org.jboss.as.controller.management-operation] (main) WFLYCTL0013: Operation ("read-attribute") failed - address: ([("host" =&gt; "master")]) - failure description: "WFLYCTL0030: No resource definition is registered for address [(\"host\" =&gt; \"master\")]"






My initial thought on this was that issue is reproducible only on virtualized systems as I saw the error only a few times on my local machine, but I tried some bare-metal servers in MWQE lab and the error poped-up quite often there.
Reproducer job (#6 and #7 ran with 7.0.0.ER2 bits) :
 - https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/job/eap-7x-cli-embed-host-reload/
In extreme cases, error can appear after every other reload operation (46 out of 99)
