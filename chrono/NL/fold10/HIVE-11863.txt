FS based stats collection generates wrong results for tez (for union queries)
FS based stats collection is the default way to collect stats. However, there are some cases (involving unions) where it generates wrong results. Refer test case in HIVE-11860 and compare test cli driver results against tez results. Also it will be good to extend statsfs.q test case with union queries.
