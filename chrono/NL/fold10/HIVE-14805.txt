Subquery inside a view will have the object in the subquery as the direct input 
Here is the repro steps.

create table t1(col string);

create view v1 as select * from t1;

create view dataview as select * from  (select * from v1) v2;

select * from dataview;



If hive is configured with authorization hook like Sentry, it will require the access not only for dataview but also for v1, which should not be required.
The subquery seems to not carry insideview property from the parent query.
