Deploying with force an unmanaged deployment makes it managed
For an unmanaged deployment if you replace it using the CLI deploy command it becomes managed.
To reproduce:






deploy /home/ehsavoie/dev/wildfly/quickstart/kitchensink-ear/ear/target/wildfly-kitchensink-ear.ear --unmanaged




deploy /home/ehsavoie/dev/wildfly/quickstart/kitchensink-ear/ear/target/wildfly-kitchensink-ear.ear --unmanaged --force






After the second command the deployment is managed.
