Metastore types are sometimes case sensitive
Impala recently encountered an issue with the metastore (IMPALA-4260 ) where column stats would get dropped when adding a column to a table.
The reason seems to be that Hive does a case sensitive check on the column stats types during an "alter table" and expects the types to be all lower case. This case sensitive check doesn&amp;apos;t appear to happen when the stats are set in the first place.
We&amp;apos;re solving this on the Impala end by storing types in the metastore as all lower case, but Hive&amp;apos;s behavior here is very confusing. It should either always be case sensitive, so that you can&amp;apos;t create column stats with types that Hive considers invalid, or it should never be case sensitive.
