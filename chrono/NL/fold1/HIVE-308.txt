UNION ALL should create different destination directories for different operands
The following query hangs:

 
select * from (select 1 from zshao_lazy union all select 2 from zshao_lazy) a;


The following query produce wrong results: (one map-reduce job overwrite/cannot overwrite the result of the other)

 
select * from (select 1 as id from zshao_lazy cluster by id union all select 2 as id from zshao_meta) a;


The reason of both is that the destination directory of the file sink operator conflicts with each other.
