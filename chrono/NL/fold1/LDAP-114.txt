Paged results doesn&apos;t work when using a single pooled connection
Paged results requires holding on to a single connection, otherwise the server cannot keep track of the current state. This can be solved somewhat "hackishly" by using a connection pool with size 1. However, the standard JNDI pool uses a weak hashmap, so the connection might be reclaimed by the garbage collector when memory is low. It&amp;apos;s possible to use the built-in Spring LDAP connection pool instead, but that requires a few modifications to Spring LDAP according to this post.
