Incoming message with with UTF-8 BOM is failing
When submitting a SOAP request that contains a UTF BOM http://unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html#22, the following fault string is returned: "Could not access envelope: Unable to create envelope from given source:"
After removing the offending BOM, and not manipulating the XML in any other way, the message is is delivered to the defined Endpoint successfully.
Per http://unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html#29 , Spring-WS should be able to transparently ignore the BOM on UTF-8 files.
