Execution key is not always incremented.
It&amp;apos;s easy to reproduce with booking-mvc. Enter Book Hotel data, go to confirm (e1s2). Press Back and press Proceed again (e1s2). I should see e1s3.
A specific use case where this is an issue is where a page has links that open browser popup windows. Each browser popup ends up with the same execution key, which is initially fine but if you try to refresh the first browser popup you get the content of the second.
