Raise an exception if a step cannot be reached.
If a &lt;job/&gt; is defined with a &lt;step/&gt; that cannot be reached during the flow of the job, then an exception should be raised by the parser.
For example, the following will raise an exception because "stepB" can never be executed.






&lt;job id="job"&gt;




    &lt;step id="stepA"/&gt;




    &lt;step id="stepB"/&gt;




&lt;/job&gt;
