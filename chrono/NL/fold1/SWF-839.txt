After JSF validation/conversion errors, state is not returned correctly
My page is showing both searchform and searchresults.
When a user inputs wrong data in the searchform, validation errors are shown correctly to the user (request 1). When he then corrects the error and resubmits, everything works fine (request 2). When he then chages any input field and submits, the search is done using the new values (request 3...n), but the page is rerendered with the values of request 2.
I was able to reproduce this on other pages (simple test pages, with 2 input fields) as well.
This issue might be related to issue 738.
