wrong request/sec in the gui reporting wrong
I am seeing lower number of request in the masters gui then I have seen in 0.18.0 while scanning.
I thank part of it is we moved to report per sec request not per 3 secs so the request should be 1/3 of the old numbers I was getting.
hbase.client.scanner.caching is not the reason the request are under reported.
I set hbase.client.scanner.caching = 1 and still get about 2K request a sec in the gui
but when the job is done I take records / job time and get 36,324/ records /sec. So
there must be some caching out side of the hbase.client.scanner.caching making the
request per sec lower then it should be. I know it running faster then reported just thought
it might give some new users the wrong impression that request/sec = read/write /sec.
