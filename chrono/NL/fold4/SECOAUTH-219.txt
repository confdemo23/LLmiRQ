Tonr2 sample doesn&apos;t work with Chrome (and some other browsers)
Tonr2 sample doesn&amp;apos;t work with Chrome (and some other browsers).  A browser that sends "Accept: /" for an &lt;img/&gt; tag will get an error from tonr2 because of SPR-7763.  The fix is easy - upgrade to Spring 3.1 properly and use the new namespace features.
