Hive Ignoring where clause for multitable insert
Hive is ignoring Filter conditions given at Multi Insert select statement when  Filtering given on Source Query..
To highlight this issue, please see below example with where clause (status!=&amp;apos;C&amp;apos;) from employee12 table causing issue and due to which insert filters (batch_id=&amp;apos;12 and batch_id!=&amp;apos;12&amp;apos; )not working and dumping all the data coming from source to both the tables.
I have checked the hive execution plan, and didn&amp;apos;t find Filter predicates under for filtering record per insert statements
from 
(from employee12
select * 
where status!=&amp;apos;C&amp;apos;) t
insert into table employee1
select 
status,
field1,
&amp;apos;T&amp;apos; as field2,
&amp;apos;P&amp;apos; as field3,
&amp;apos;C&amp;apos; as field4
where batch_id=&amp;apos;12&amp;apos;
insert into table employee2
select
status,
field1,
&amp;apos;D&amp;apos; as field2, 
&amp;apos;P&amp;apos; as field3,
&amp;apos;C&amp;apos; as field4
where batch_id!=&amp;apos;12&amp;apos;;
It is working fine with single insert. Hive generating plan properly.. 
I am able to reproduce this issue with 8.1 and 9.0 version of Hive.
