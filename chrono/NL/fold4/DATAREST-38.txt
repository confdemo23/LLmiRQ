Listing relations with Accept:application/x-spring-data-compact-json does not contain self link.
When loading a relation like this: 
http://localhost:8080/rest/entity/6bf64863-2c1f-4661-b54b-7611971b36aa/relation/a6ae6a94-31f9-47a5-9904-329477ab54d0
with: 
"application/x-spring-data-compact+json" as Accept-Type, the result does not contain a self link. The same for "application/json" as Accept-Type.
This worked before and also works for:
http://localhost:8080/rest/entity/ etc.
