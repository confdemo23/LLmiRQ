resource-adapter id attribute is forced to match rar name
If the id of the resource adapter element does not match the name of the
RAR file, the CLI will throw the following error on RA activation:

{

    "outcome" =&gt; "failed",

    "failure-description" =&gt; "rar not yet deployed",

    "rolled-back" =&gt; true

}
