Changes to page pictures property will break API binding
On 10/3/2012 the Facebook API will be changed such that the pictures property on page objects will no longer be a string, but will instead be an object. This will break the existing API binding when trying to deserialize the picture property. In mid-August 2012, Facebook applied this breaking change, but apps can be reconfigured (temporarily) to opt out of the change.
See https://developers.facebook.com/roadmap/#october-2012 for details.
The Spring Social Facebook API binding should be fixed to address this change in time for the October 3rd change.
