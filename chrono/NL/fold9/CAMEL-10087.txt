camel-kafka does not work in OSGI container
Currently this component is broken in OSGI environment due to this:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-3218
We can leave it broken until they get their bugs worked out.  Or i can submit a PR with an intermediate fix that should work, as described in the jira noted above.
