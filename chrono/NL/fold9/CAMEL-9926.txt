HTTP Proxy support in Salesforce component is broken with upgrade to Jetty9
HTTP Proxy support in Jetty9 Client is broken, which causes HTTP Proxy tests in the Salesforce components to fail. 
They have been marked as ignored for now, but it MUST be fixed in Jetty9 ASAP and the component updated to use the new version of Jetty9 client with working support for Proxy authentication.
