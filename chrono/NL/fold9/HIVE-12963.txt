LIMIT statement with SORT BY creates additional MR job with hardcoded only one reducer
I execute query:
hive&gt; select age from test1 sort by age.age  limit 10;                      
Total jobs = 2
Launching Job 1 out of 2
Number of reduce tasks not specified. Estimated from input data size: 1
Launching Job 2 out of 2
Number of reduce tasks determined at compile time: 1
When I have a large number of rows then the last stage of the job takes a long time. I think we could allow to user choose number of reducers of last job or refuse extra MR job.
The same behavior I observed with querie:
hive&gt; create table new_test as select age from test1 group by age.age  limit 10;
