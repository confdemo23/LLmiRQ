Trailing spaces in partition column will be treated differently
We store the partition spec value in the metastore. In mysql (and derby i think), the trailing space is ignored. That is, if you have a partition column "col" (type varchar or string) with value "a " and then select from the table where col = "a", it will return. However, in postgres and Oracle, the trailing space is not ignored.
