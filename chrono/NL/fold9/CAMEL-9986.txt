MIME-Multipart Data Format is inconsistent if trying to unmarshal non-MIME data
If data that is not a MIME-Multipart is tried to marshal with the headersInline option set to false, no error is thrown and the message is left as the original message.
In case the headersInline option is set to true, an empty message is returned.
The provided patch changes the behavior that it also tries to return the original message in case the message is not a mime-multipart and headersInline is set to true. However there are limits to this: If the message body is a stream and stream caching is not enabled it is necessary to read the stream in order to find out whether this is a MIME-Multipart or not. Afterwards the message body will be empty (as with the previous implementation).
