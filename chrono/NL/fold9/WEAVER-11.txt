bytecode generated with java 7 or 8 is different and can break on earlier versions
Encountered on bval where building with java 8 makes the bytecode java 8 compliant and breaks under java 7.
See org.apache.bval.util.reflection.Reflection#setAccessible where  Utf8               java/lang/reflect/Executable is injected with java 8 and Executable is a java 8 class only.
