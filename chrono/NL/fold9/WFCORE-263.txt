Cancelling management op on slave HC tree is broken
If you have a DC with a slave HC, and perform a management operation which gets stuck, non-progressing operations will be reported for both the DC and the slave HC via:
/host=master/core-service=management/service=management-operations:find-non-progressing-operation
/host=slave/core-service=management/service=management-operations:find-non-progressing-operation
Cancelling the operation under /host=master works as expected, pushing the cancellation down to the slave and the controllers become responsive again.
If however you attempt to cancel the operation under /host=slave, it goes bad. 
{ "outcome" =&gt; "success", "result" =&gt; undefined }
 is reported in the CLI, but the controllers are still unresponsive.
Running :find-non-progressing-operation against the slave will report the 
{outcome=success,result=undefined}
 rather than that no non-progressing operations were found, and active-operation=*:read-resource() shows it as not cancelled.
Once you attempt to cancel it on a slave, attempting to cancel it under /host=master will report success, but leave the slave op in a weird state, and things requiring the controller lock (such as the web UI) will still not respond.
