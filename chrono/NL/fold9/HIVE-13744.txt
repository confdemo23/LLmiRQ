LLAP IO - add complex types support
Recently, complex type column vectors were added to Hive. We should use them in IO elevator.
Vectorization itself doesn&amp;apos;t support complex types (yet), but this would be useful when it does, also it will enable LLAP IO elevator to be used in non-vectorized context with complex types after HIVE-13617
