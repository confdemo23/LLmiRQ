camel-jetty - Should support multipart/form posted data in the message body better
See CAMEL-1801
It does not work as expected as the posted data should be in the body and not as it does currently stored as a message header with the body as a key and with an empty value!
For instance sending a file using curl

curl -F data=@src/test/data/plain.txt http://localhost:9080/myapp/myservice


You want Camel to provide the file content in the body and the other as headers. But what you get in the body is

------------------------------30cc29f24df6
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="data"; filename="plain.txt"
Content-Type: text/plain

Hello World
This is the second line
