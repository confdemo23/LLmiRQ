Spring DSL - Some route scoped concerns such as onException etc. can vanish in some edge cases
The JAXB creates the Spring DSL model in a bit wacky way so we need to work on it a bit before Camel can create the runtime routes.
In some cases some of the cross functions such as onCompletion, onException could potentially vanish. 
The problem is really that we should have divided the route into a upper / lower section where upper is the cross functions and the lower the actual route.
