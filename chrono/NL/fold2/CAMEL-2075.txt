camel-bean - When a method name is given it should be more strict to be sure always invoking a method with that name
You could potential invoke another method name if you have annotated that with a Camel annotation. Even if you have told Camel that the method should be named foo etc.
What Camel should do is to ensure that only methods with the name foo is possible to invoke.
