Rollback does not work for transactional routes using camel-cxf
I have a request reply service that should be able to do three different
things:
1)  no exception occurs in the implementation: The jms Message should be
committed and the normal reply should be sent
2) The implementation throws an exception defined in the service contract:
The jms message should be committed and a fault should be sent
3) The implemementation throws another kind of exception: The message delivery should
be rolled back so it can be received again
Case 1 and 2 currently work as expected.
For Case 3 a fault is returned to the caller and the transaction is committed which is wrong.
