Backup does not include empty directories (like src/main/resources)
The "backup" command does not include empty directories.
This causes problems if people use the backup command to make a ZIP file that other person attempt to then use with Eclipse (via mvn eclipse:eclipse). Eclipse reports a missing src/main/resources directory.
