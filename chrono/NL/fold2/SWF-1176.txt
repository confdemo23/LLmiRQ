Web Flow first wants to resolve the model before even checking if a databinding should be done at all
Filed on behalf of Agim Emruli, Agim.Emruli@springsource.com in regards to Support Issue #7504.
Web Flow has a small "bug" that it first wants to resolve the model before even checking if a data binding should be done at all.  There is no need to retrieve a model object if there is no data binding at all.
Attached is a patch that fixes the issue.
It would be great if this can be included into the standard web flow release.  If it cannot, then a customer specific release will need to be packaged to address the issue.
Thanks
