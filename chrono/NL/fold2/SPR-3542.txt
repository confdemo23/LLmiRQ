scope (& similar attributes) on abstract beans should be inherited in child beans, or not permitted
Hi,
given this config:
&lt;bean id="parent" scope="prototype" abstract="true"&gt;
    &lt;property name="prop" ref="prop" /&gt;
     .....
&lt;/bean&gt;
&lt;bean id="child1" parent="parent" class="X" /&gt;
&lt;bean id="child2" parent="parent" class="X" /&gt;
&lt;bean id="child3" parent="parent" scope="singleton" class="X" /&gt;
the prototype attribute on the abstract parent does not carry down to any child beans.  So child1 &amp; 2 here are scoped singleton, wouldn&amp;apos;t it make sense to inherit that?  I am not sure, just throwing this out there for someone to consider.  If it does, the child beans could also override scope and the similar attributes. 
If it doesn&amp;apos;t make sense, abstract="true" &amp; scope="*" should probably generate an xml error since they will be a waste of typing.
