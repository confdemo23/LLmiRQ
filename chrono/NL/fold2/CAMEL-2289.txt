camel-bindy - csv - Make it easier to marshal with POJO out of the box
Its to ugly that you must use List&lt;Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&gt; to wrap you POJO to let Bindy be able to marhal my POJO to a CSV record.
It should be able to detect that its not a List but a plain POJO and construct the List itself and based on defaults.
