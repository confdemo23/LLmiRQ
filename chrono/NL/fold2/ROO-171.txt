Incorrect help text for "new integration test" shell command
If you type "help" at the roo prompt, the displayed help text includes these two lines:
...

new dod - Creates a new data on demand for the specified entity
new integration test - Creates a new data on demand for the specified entity
...

The second message of the two shown above seems to be an unintended duplicate.
