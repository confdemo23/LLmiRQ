Creating a transacted pipeline with custom error handling is difficult
When trying to add error logging to a transacted pipeline, I discovered the following issues:
(1) onException/onCompletion do not work in a transacted route
(2) if the transacted tag is not the first element in the route, all the endpoints above it will be silently ignored
(3) custom error handlers interact very awkwardly with transacted routes (specifically, a non-transacted error handler will not work at all on a transacted route)
I was able to solve my problem using doTry/doCatch; this may be a good candidate for adding to the docs.
I suggest that, if the above issues are not corrected (especially 2+3, which may not be route designs that it is desired to support), they should trigger errors in the corresponding pipeline.
I have attached a tgz of examples showing problems (1) and (2) above, as well as my successful route.
