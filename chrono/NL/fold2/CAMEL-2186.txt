if ftp endpoint is not writeable, the only messages you get are logged at DEBUG level.
Using the same project attached to CAMEL-2165, you can delete the "ftp_home" directory, or simply edit user.properties to make the ftp account readonly.
While every single write to the camel ftp endpoint will then fail, the only notification of this is at DEBUG level.  In my opinion this should be at least WARN
