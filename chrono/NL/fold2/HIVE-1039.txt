multi-insert doesn&apos;t work for local directories
As wd pointed out in hive-user, the following query only load data to the first local directory. Multi-insert to tables works fine. 
hive&gt; from test
    &gt; INSERT OVERWRITE LOCAL DIRECTORY &amp;apos;/home/stefdong/tmp/0&amp;apos; select *
where a = 1
    &gt; INSERT OVERWRITE LOCAL DIRECTORY &amp;apos;/home/stefdong/tmp/1&amp;apos; select *
where a = 3;
