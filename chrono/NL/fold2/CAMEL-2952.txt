camel-ftp - Support polling from MVS file system
The MVS file system requires to change directory to starting path and use CD to traverse file path instead of using listFile(path) as currently done in camel-ftp.
This means we should walk the path using code like:
0. remember path
1. cd path
2. list files()
3. loop files
4. if dir then goto 1
5. if file add file
6. when done cd back to "remember path"
