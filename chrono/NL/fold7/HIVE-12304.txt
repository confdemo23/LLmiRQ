"drop database cascade" needs to unregister functions
Currently "drop database cascade" command doesn&amp;apos;t unregister the functions under the database. If the functions are not unregistered, in some cases like "describe db1.func1" will still show the info for the function; or if the same database is recreated, "drop if exists db1.func1" will throw an exception since the function is considered existing from the registry while it doesn&amp;apos;t exist in metastore.
