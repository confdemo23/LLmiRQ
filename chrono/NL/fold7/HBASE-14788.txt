Splitting a region does not support the hbase.rs.evictblocksonclose config when closing source region
i have a table with bucket cache turned on and hbase.rs.evictblocksonclose set to false.  I split a region and watched that the closing of the source region did not complete until the bucketcache was flushed for that region.
