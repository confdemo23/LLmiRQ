combining properties which use 3+ part names discards entries as of Commons 1.6+
When two property files are combined using commons config 1.5, the aggregate configuration returns an expected result of 6 entries. If Commons configuration 1.6 or higher is used, the resulting set drops to  which is not expected. 
The property names include 2, 3 or 4 part names X.Y, X.Y.Z etc and it appears that as of 1.6 if the names are arranged in 2 part, then 3 part etc that the combiner returns the expected result.
There does not appear to be any release notes etc that would suggest  that this isn&amp;apos;t a defect versus an intended implementation change.
