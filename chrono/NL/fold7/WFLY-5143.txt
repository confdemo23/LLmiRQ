JGroups subsystem parser should not allow thread pool to be defined per protocol
In this case, the parser does not match the schemas.  There are 3 issues here:

Thread pool elements should only be parsed for schema version &gt;= 3.0
Thread pool elements are only valid children of a &lt;transport/&gt; element, but are currently accepted as children of a &lt;protocol/&gt; element.
We should always create thread pool resources, even if xml is undefined - that way the thread pool parameters, as applied to the runtime, are expressed in the model.
