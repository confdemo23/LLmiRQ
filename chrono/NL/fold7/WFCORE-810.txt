Audit log handler sub-resources cannot be removed in same op as the handler
The various child resources under the management audit log syslog handler resources implement the runtime part of  "remove" by trying to read the resource tree starting at the parent and then constructing and registering a new audit log handler.
This will fail if the child resource and the parent audit log handler resource are both removed in separate steps in the same composite op. The read of the parent will fail as it will be gone by Stage.RUNTIME.
The composite thing is kind of an edge case (since just the parent can be removed) but it also interferes with WFCORE-808.
