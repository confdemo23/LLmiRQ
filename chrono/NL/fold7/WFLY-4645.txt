access log rotates even when rotation is disabled by "rotate" attribute
When I disable access log rotation by setting "rotate" attribute to false:






/subsystem=undertow/server=default-server/host=default-host/setting=access-log/:write-attribute(name=rotate,value=false)






The logfile keeps rotating - how tested in "Steps to Reproduce" section.
