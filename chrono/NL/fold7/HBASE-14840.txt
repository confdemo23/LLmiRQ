Sink cluster reports data replication request as success though the data is not replicated
Scenario:
Sink cluster is down
Create a table and enable table replication
Put some data
Now restart the sink cluster
Observance:
Data is not replicated in sink cluster but still source cluster updates the WAL log position in ZK, resulting in data loss in sink cluster.
