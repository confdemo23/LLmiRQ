Map Side aggregation affecting map performance
When trying to run a simple aggregation query with hive.map.aggr=true, map tasks take a lot of time in Hive 0.14 as against  with hive.map.aggr=false.
e.g.
Consider the query:



INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE lineitem_tgt_agg

select alias.a0 as a0,

 alias.a2 as a1,

 alias.a1 as a2,

 alias.a3 as a3,

 alias.a4 as a4

from (

 select alias.a0 as a0,

  SUM(alias.a1) as a1,

  SUM(alias.a2) as a2,

  SUM(alias.a3) as a3,

  SUM(alias.a4) as a4

 from (

  select lineitem_sf500.l_orderkey as a0,

   CAST(lineitem_sf500.l_quantity * lineitem_sf500.l_extendedprice * (1 - lineitem_sf500.l_discount) * (1 + lineitem_sf500.l_tax) as double) as a1,

   lineitem_sf500.l_quantity as a2,

   CAST(lineitem_sf500.l_quantity * lineitem_sf500.l_extendedprice * lineitem_sf500.l_discount as double) as a3,

   CAST(lineitem_sf500.l_quantity * lineitem_sf500.l_extendedprice * lineitem_sf500.l_tax as double) as a4

  from lineitem_sf500

  ) alias

 group by alias.a0

 ) alias;



The above query was run with ~376GB of data / ~3billion records in the source.
It takes ~10 minutes with hive.map.aggr=false.
With map side aggregation set to true, the map tasks don&amp;apos;t complete even after an hour.
