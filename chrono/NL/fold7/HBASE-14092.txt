hbck should run without locks by default and only disable the balancer when necessary
HBCK is sometimes used as a way to check the health of the cluster. When doing that it&amp;apos;s not necessary to turn off the balancer. As such it&amp;apos;s not needed to lock other runs of hbck out.
We should add the --no-lock and --no-balancer command line flags.
