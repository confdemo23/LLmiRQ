Join sql cannot get result
I found a join issue in hive-1.2.1 and hive-1.1.1.
The create table sql is as below.



CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS join_case(

    orderid  bigint,

    tradeitemid bigint,

    id bigint

) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED

FIELDS TERMINATED BY &amp;apos;,&amp;apos; 

LINES TERMINATED BY &amp;apos;\n&amp;apos;

STORED AS TEXTFILE;



Please put attached sample data file 000000_0 in /tmp/join_case folder.
Then load data.



LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH &amp;apos;/tmp/join_case/000000_0&amp;apos; OVERWRITE INTO TABLE join_case;



Run the following sql, but cannot get searching result.



select a.id from 

(

select orderid as orderid, max(id) as id from join_case group by orderid

) a 

join 

(

select id as id , orderid as orderid from join_case

) b

on a.id = b.id limit 10;



This issue also occurs in hive-1.1.0-cdh5.4.5.
But in apache hive-1.0.1 the above sql can return 10 rows.
After exchanging the sequence of "orderid as orderid" and "max(id) as id", the following sql can get result in hive-1.2.1 and hive-1.1.1.



select a.id from 

(

select max(id) as id, orderid as orderid from join_case group by orderid

) a 

join 

(

select id as id , orderid as orderid from join_case

) b

on a.id = b.id limit 10;



Also, the following sql can get results in hive-1.2.1 and hive-1.1.1.



select a.id from 

(

select orderid as orderid, id as id from join_case group by orderid, id

) a 

join 

(

select id as id , orderid as orderid from join_case

) b

on a.id = b.id limit 10; 



Anyone can take a look at this issue? 
Thanks.
