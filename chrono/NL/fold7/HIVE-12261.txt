schematool version info exit status should depend on compatibility, not equality
Newer versions of metastore schema are compatible with older versions of hive, as only new tables or columns are added with additional information.
HIVE-11613 added a check in hive schematool -info command to see if schema version is equal. 
However, the state where db schema version is ahead of hive software version is often seen when a &amp;apos;rolling upgrade&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;rolling downgrade&amp;apos; is happening. This is a state where hive is functional and returning non zero status for it is misleading.
