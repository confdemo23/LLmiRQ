Incorrect results with orc ppd across ORC versions
Run vector_decimal_cast.q on tez cli driver.
The issue is related to the ORC Timestamp column stats, which does not exist in all ORC files. 
When the timestamp column is missing stats, default to YES_NO_NULL instead of assuming the column is all nulls.
