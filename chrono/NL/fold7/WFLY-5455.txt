[Migration operation] [Web to Undertow] migration of access-log prefix attribute doesn&apos;t take into account default value resulting in incosistent result.
Access log prefix in web subsystem is by default access-log., in Undertow subsystem it is access-log. Note the difference, there is "." at the end in case of Web.
There is inconsistency of migrate operation when migrating prefix attribute. When prefix is not explicitly defined in Web (=&gt; default is used =&gt; access-log., note the dot at the end. It is migrated to default Undertow prefix, which is access-log (missing "." at the end). 
In case of having explicitely set prefix="access-log.", it is the same value as the default value in Web and in this case this is migrated to access-log. (the "." is there).
=&gt; two equivalent Web subsystem configuration of access-log result in two different configurations in Undertow, which is not expected behaviour.
As this impacts only access-log naming, I am considering this only as minor issue.
