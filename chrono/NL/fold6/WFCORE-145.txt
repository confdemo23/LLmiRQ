CLI run-batch command cannot process files with comments or blank lines
In the JBoss CLI tool, the "run-batch --file=script.cli" command cannot
successfully process lines that start with "#" or blank lines. Comments and
blank lines help readability when creating cli batch scripts.
However, running the batch file containing comments/blank lines as a parameter
to jboss-cli.sh works just fine (./jboss-cli.sh -c --file=script.cli). This
difference in accepted syntax creates some confusion for users who are new to
the CLI tool.
