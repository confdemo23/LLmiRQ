Beider Morse Phonetic Matching producing incorrect tokens
I believe the Beider Morse Phonetic Matching algorithm was added in Commons Codec 1.6
The BMPM algorithm is an EVOLVING algorithm that is currently on version 3.02 though it had been static since version 3.01 dated 19 Dec 2011 (it was first available as opensource as version 1.00 on 6 May 2009).
I can see nothing in the Commons Codec Docs to say which version of BMPM was implemented so I am not sure if the problem with the algorithm as coded in the Codec is simply an old version or whether there are more basic problems with the implementation.
How do I determine the version of the algorithm that was implemented in the Commons Codec?
How do we ensure that the algorithm is updated if/when the BMPM algorithm changes?
How do we ensure that the algorithm as coded in the Commons Codec is accurate and working as expected?
