Weld subsystem exposes way too much dependancies to user deployment
module org.jboss.as.weld should not be added as dependency to user deployment.
It has way too much dependencies and some of them export their dependencies which than end up in user deployment.
We should probably have extra module for stuff that is exposed to deployment.
Also lots of dependencies that weld subsystem has should be optional as we shouldn&amp;apos;t be required to have dependency to almost every single subsystem we have as required.
