Camel : RSS - Ignores posts with identical published or updated date.
When running with a RSS feed which has multiple entries with the same date only the first one is read, the rest are ignored because of the date filter.  I have provided a rudimental fix and unit test for this issue, this hashes the entries to detect duplicates.
