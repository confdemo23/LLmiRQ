Selenium error reports are delivered in target/target rather than just in target
It looks like the Selenium test output is placed one extra directory deep, in target/target rather than just in target.  The problem is due to the generated selenium configuration:
&lt;results&gt;$
{project.build.directory}/target/selenium.txt&lt;/results&gt;
should be
&lt;results&gt;${project.build.directory}
/selenium.txt&lt;/results&gt;
