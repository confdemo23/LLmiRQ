camel-mail - Add option to control if mail folder should be closed after poll
It should be possible to control if the mail folder should be closed after a poll or not.
For example if people is routing mails over SEDA or other async endpoints, then we should not close the mail folder before the mail message is being processed async.
We have a similar option on mina,netty etc. named disconnect. So the option could be named like that as well.
