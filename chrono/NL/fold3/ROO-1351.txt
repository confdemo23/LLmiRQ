Maven dependency not added to project&apos;s pom.xml when the jdbc driver is used for more than one database
When executing the "persistence setup" command, the maven dependency for the selected --database is removed if the JDBC driver is the same for more than one database provider. For example, MS SQL and Sybase use the same driver, jTDS.
