Using the "*" wildcard in intercept-method does not include implemented interfaces
Created on behalf of client, with the following use case:
1.  Bean is secured via the intercept-methods tag.
2.  The method attributed of the protect tag is set to "*"
3.  Bean implements an interface and is annotated with @Transactional.
4.  None of the methods on the interface are protected unless the interface is explicitly defined in the method attribute.
In this case only the methods on the bean, not the interface are secured when the method is "".  They feel that in addition to the methods declared on the bean, all implemented interface methods should also be secured when the "" is specified for the method.
Attached is a sample test case illustrating the behavior.
