ROO should not add a dependency to the pom if it is already in the pom as "provided"
Example:
If I change the jstl dependency to provided scope in the pom, ROO will re-add the dependency the next time I run the controller scaffold command.  The end result is I now have jstl defined twice in the pom.  Once without scope and once with provided.
This should not happen with any dependency, so I am not sure if this is specific to the addon-web-mvc-controller or it would happen with other add ons as well.
