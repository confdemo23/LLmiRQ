Support for &apos;groups&apos; in addition to @Valid for @MVC Controllers
I want to be able to specify the JSR303 validation group when specifying @Valid in @Controller-s.
I don&amp;apos;t want the validation to be run against the default group every time.
I guess currently I can inject a javax.validation.Validator reference in the @Controller and handle this programmatically. Would be nice if this can be driven through an annotation as well.
But @Valid doesn&amp;apos;t support a "group" attribute though.
What do you guys think?
