REST Crash on HTC Mytouch 4g
See issue: http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/issues/detail?id=255
Essentially, HTC has bundled an (old, broken) copy of gson with some builds of HTC Sense and exposed it on the classpath.  As a result, the REST client sees it on the classpath and attempts to load it.  Unfortunately, this crashes.
