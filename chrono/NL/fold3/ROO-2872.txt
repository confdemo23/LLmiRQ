String index out of range -1 when launching roo from a non empty directory
I am consistently able to create a "String index out of range -1" exception when launching the roo shell from a non-empty directory that contains at least 1 java file.  Attached is the output of the commands that consistently recreate this.
I am currently using 1.2.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT [rev babe22d]
