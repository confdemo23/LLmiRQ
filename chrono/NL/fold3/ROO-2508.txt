@Rooplural annotation prevents "list all entity" option from showing in the menu
When a @Rooplural is added to an entity the "list all entity" option from the navigation menu of the app isn&amp;apos;t displayed, that means that the corresponding item in menu.jspx for list the item isn&amp;apos;t added. This seems to be a Roo issue since it happens with recently created projects where no configuration file was changed manually. 
In the original thread on the forum I reported the issue for version 1.1.3 but recently I confirmed that the 1.1.4 version has the same problem. I don&amp;apos;t know if the usage of @Rooplural was changed in recent versions but in the documentation I don&amp;apos;t found anything. 
Thanks for all, regards.
