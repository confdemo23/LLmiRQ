Tab completion ignores some available commands
If two or more commands have the same first word(s), then only one of them will be offered by the shell when you type those word(s) and press TAB. For example, these commands should be available all the time:

metadata for id
metadata for type
metadata status
metadata trace

If you type "metadata" and press TAB, the shell responds with "metadata trace", when it should offer you at least the above choices. Likewise if you type "metadata for" and press TAB, you get "metadata for id" instead of a choice between that and "metadata for type".
The workaround is to backspace over the unwanted completion and enter the first few letters of the desired completion, e.g. "metadata for t" will correctly give you "metadata for type". However this approach is only practical if you already know what command you want, which largely defeats the purpose of tab completion.
