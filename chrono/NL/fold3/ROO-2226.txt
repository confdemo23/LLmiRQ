Adding tag attributes starting  with &apos;_&apos;  does not work as expected - They are deleted on re-generation 
I tried to add a custom attribute "_multipart" to the form:create tag.
According too Roo documentation , attributes with leading "_" are not included in the hashcode (z attribute) ... So I expected I could use them without intefering with Roo code generation.
So, I tried to use this new attribute in a Roo-mangaed view: 
&lt;form:create id="fc_..." _multipart="true" ...&gt;
But next time the view was regenerated, this attribute was removed again. Even worse: All changes I had made in the content of the form tag (f.e. some field customization "rendered="false") were also lost.
I seems, the whole form element and all of its content has been re-generated...
