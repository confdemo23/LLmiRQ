Maven plugin camel-api-component-maven-plugin cannot read empty API name for components with single proxy class
Maven has a known issue where empty parameter values are set as null value for properties and plugin configuration parameters. This throws an error with the message "Properties apiName and proxyClass are required".
The camel-api-component-maven-plugin must explicitly set the apiName to "" for this use case for single proxy class API components.
