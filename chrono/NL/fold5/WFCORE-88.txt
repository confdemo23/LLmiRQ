Management interface to track (timestamp) when an application was last deployed.

When an application is Deployed/Undeployed or Enabled/Disabled then there should be some mechanism in order to track the timestamp of these events  using some CLI commands.


This will help in tracking when last time the application was enabled/disabled/deployed/undeployed.

I have some reservations about this as it&amp;apos;s not clear why these management resources should be treated differently from other resources in terms of showing this kind of information about their history. But there&amp;apos;s user demand for it and Claudio Miranda is doing good work on implementing it, so I&amp;apos;m fine with it.
