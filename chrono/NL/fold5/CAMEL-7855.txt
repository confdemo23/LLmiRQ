If you suspend a JMS route that is stopped, calling resume on it does not work and reports no error
If a route that consumes from JMS is in state Stopped, and first Suspend and then Resume are called upon it, the route reports itself as being in state Started. However, it is not actually consuming anything from the endpoint.
