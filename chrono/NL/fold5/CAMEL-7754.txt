Property Trigger.timerZone is declared as constant but not implemented
Seems that we have a problem with Quartz/Quartz2 components. The doc claims that we can setup this property in the URI "trigger.timeZone" (http://camel.apache.org/quartz.html - see specifying timezone ) but quartz don&amp;apos;t use it even if a constant is defined :https://www.dropbox.com/s/1wjt3slsz3jajlh/Screenshot%202014-08-27%2010.29.53.png?dl=0
We have the same issue too with quartz2 --&gt; https://www.dropbox.com/s/jcxnn72bzi38qob/Screenshot%202014-08-27%2010.31.34.png?dl=0
