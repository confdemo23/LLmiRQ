NPE in Aggregator when completionSize = 1
A Camel aggregator with persistence repository cannot have a completionSize of 1. If this is configured, every message produces a NPE with the attached stacktrace. 
I have also attached a small example project that shows the Exception. As soon as the completionSize is &gt; 1, it runs fine.
This is just a minor flaw, since I cannot think about a really useful case with completionSize 1, but it worked with earlier versions of Camel. 
As an alternative (if completionSize 1 should not be used), Camel could throw an error during Context startup when completionSize &lt; 2.
