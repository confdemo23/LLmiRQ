"alter table add partition" should support db_name.table_name as table name.
Currently, 
"alter table table_name add partition ...." works.
but
"alter table db_name.table_name add partition ..." throws an error message (different error for different versions).
For consistency, I suggest with support both ways of referring to a table.
