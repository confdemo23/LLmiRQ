CLI shutting down a slave disconnects from the master
If I issue a shutdown command for a slave HC, the CLI gets disconnected:
[domain@localhost:9999 /] shutdown --host=slave-a
[disconnected /] shutdown --host=slave-b
The command is not available in the current context (e.g. required subsystems or connection to the controller might be unavailable).
[disconnected /] cd /
The command is not available in the current context (e.g. required subsystems or connection to the controller might be unavailable).
[disconnected /] connect
[domain@localhost:9999 /] shutdown --host=slave-b
[disconnected /]
