EJBs with same Java class name not intercepted by CDI interceptors
Given
Two or more EJBs with the same Java class name but from different Java deployments.
Problem
Interceptor intercepts method calls to only one of the EJBs.
An EJB to be intercepted seems to be chosen randomly after each redeployment.
