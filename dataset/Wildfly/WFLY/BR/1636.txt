Children coming from a ManagementResourceRegistration.registerOverrideModel() override incorrectly appear as attributes in read-resource-description
The problem is in OverrideDescriptionCombiner adding the overridden children to the attributes rather than to the children. For background, this was my initial mail on the subject.
-------
I found this when trying to read the role based access control settings for the whole of WIldFly. I have worked around this with a hack on my https://github.com/kabir/wildfly/commits/rbac-play branch, which is called "Temp commit, work around problems in /subsystem=datasources/data-source=* definition of statistics". The underlying problem seems to be that there is a problem with the resource definition for this attribute/child type. Apart from this there are no other problems when running with standalone-full-ha.xml.
The &amp;apos;statistics&amp;apos; appears as an attribute when doing a read-resource-description
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=datasources/data-source=ExampleDS:read-resource-description                     
{
   "outcome" =&gt; "success",
   "result" =&gt; {
       "description" =&gt; "A JDBC data-source configuration",
       "attributes" =&gt; {
           "share-prepared-statements" =&gt; 
{

               "type" =&gt; BOOLEAN,

               "description" =&gt; "Whether to share prepared statements, i.e. whether asking for same statement twice without closing uses the same underlying prepared statement",

               "expressions-allowed" =&gt; true,

               "nillable" =&gt; true,

               "default" =&gt; false,

               "access-type" =&gt; "read-write",

               "storage" =&gt; "configuration",

               "restart-required" =&gt; "no-services"

           }
,
 SNIP
           "statistics" =&gt; 
{

               "description" =&gt; "Runtime statistics provided by the resource adapter.",

               "access-type" =&gt; "read-only",

               "storage" =&gt; "configuration"

           }
       },
       "operations" =&gt; undefined,
       "children" =&gt; {"connection-properties" =&gt; {
           "description" =&gt; "The connection-properties element allows you to pass in arbitrary connection properties to the Driver.connect(url, props) method",
           "model-description" =&gt; undefined
       }}
   }
}
However, it does not appears as a child but not as an attribute:
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=datasources/data-source=ExampleDS:read-children-names(child-type=statistics)
{

   "outcome" =&gt; "success",

   "result" =&gt; [

       "jdbc",

       "pool"

   ]

}
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=datasources/data-source=ExampleDS:read-attribute(name=statistics)
{

   "outcome" =&gt; "failed",

   "failure-description" =&gt; "JBAS014640: &amp;apos;statistics&amp;apos; is a registered child of resource ([

   (\"subsystem\" =&gt; \"datasources\"),

   (\"data-source\" =&gt; \"ExampleDS\")

])",

   "rolled-back" =&gt; true

}

In read-resource it appears as a child:
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=datasources/data-source=ExampleDS:read-resource(recursive=true, include-runtime=true)
{
   "outcome" =&gt; "success",
   "result" =&gt; {
