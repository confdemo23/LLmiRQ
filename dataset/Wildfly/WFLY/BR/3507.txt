REGRESSION: JSP servlet cannot be mapped to different extensions
When migrating an app from JBoss 7.1.1.Final to WildFly 8.1.0.Final, one can no longer remap the default JSP servlet to different extensions.
This is useful when you want some lightweight server-side processing of, say, JavaScript or CSS files.
