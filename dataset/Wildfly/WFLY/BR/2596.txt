JASPI Web layer problems
I have found several problems in the current (master, trunk) Wildfly JASPI Web layer implementation
Undertow related:
----------------------

It does not support pre-emptive authentication:
When the ServerAuthenticationModule returns AUTH_SUCCESS and null userPrincipal, it should let the request fall through unathenticated, instead it is rejected.


It does not call secureResponse when the authentication was unsuccessful


It does not populate the org.jboss.security.SecurityContext, only the undertow Account structure.


It does not support the wrapper feature (Spec 3.8.3.5 and B.9)

The attached pull request aims to fix the first three issues.
Credits: This patch is based on Arjan Tijms&amp;apos; analysis, and suggested patches for the Jboss 7.X valve based authentitactor.
