JDBC driver module-slot is not persisted in domain mode
The module-slot of jdbc-driver is NOT persisted in domain mode, but it is persisted in standalone mode.
After debugging, I found that the performRuntime() method of JdbcDriverAdd.java is not called in domain mode, but is called in standalone mode.
