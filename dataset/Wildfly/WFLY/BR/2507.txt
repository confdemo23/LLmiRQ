InflowFlatTestCase and InflowJarTestCase are failing on Windows
Tests are consisently failing on Windows but not on Linux:
http://brontes.lab.eng.brq.redhat.com/project.html?projectId=WF&amp;testNameId=-4393166542338832492&amp;tab=testDetails
Typically that would indicate a problem that manifests when tests are run in a different order; i.e. one test leaving behind something that impacts another.
I suspect what&amp;apos;s happening here is an RA is getting left behind and these tests are finding the wrong one and making assertions against it.
Note this in the test is used to find the RA id:
Set&lt;String&gt; ids = repository.getResourceAdapters();






		assertNotNull(ids);




		System.out.println("////RA" + ids.toString());




		String piId = getElementContaining(ids,        "MultipleResourceAdapter");






The test logging shows there are two RAs that would match:
03:45:54,709 INFO  [stdout] (pool-1-thread-4) ////RAorg.jboss.as.test.integration.jca.rar.MultipleResourceAdapter#27, org.jboss.as.test.integration.jca.rar.MultipleResourceAdapter#28
