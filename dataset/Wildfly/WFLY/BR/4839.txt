annotation must be scanned regardless of the version of web.xml unless metadata-complete is explicitly set to true






### Description of problem:









Annotation must be scanned regardless of the version of web.xml unless metadata-complete is explicitly set to true.









Note that Servlet 3.0 specification clearly states the following:









~~~




1.6.2 Processing annotations




In Servlet 2.5, metadata-complete only affected the scanning of annotations at




deployment time. The notion of web-fragments did not exist in servlet 2.5. However




in servlet 3.0 metadata-complete affects scanning of all annotations and web-




fragments at deployment time. The version of the descriptor MUST not affect which




annotations you scan for in a web application. An implementation of a particular




version of the specification MUST scan for all annotations supported in that




configuration, unless metadata-complete is specified.




~~~














### How reproducible:









Anytime














### Steps to Reproduce:









1. Create a library jar which contains a servlet filter using @WebFilter 




2. Put the jar under WEB-INF/lib of the web application which web.xml version is 2.3 or 2.4




3. Start JBoss EAP 6




4. Access the web application and see if the servlet filter works














### Actual results:









The servlet filter is not invoked














### Expected results:









The servlet filter is invoked














### Additional info:









It works when the version of web.xml is 2.5 or 3.0

It looks metadata-complete is always set to true when the version of web.xml is 2.3 or 2.4 at the line 96 of web/src/main/java/org/jboss/as/web/deployment/WarMetaDataProcessor.java.









Though Servlet 2.3/2.3 specification does not have metadata-complete attribute, Servlet 3.0 specification states the following. I think it means that the metadata-complete attribute default to false if it is not specified.

8.1 Annotations and pluggability




if the metadata-complete attribute is not specified or is set to "false", the




deployment tool must examine the class files of the application for annotations, and




scan for web fragments.
