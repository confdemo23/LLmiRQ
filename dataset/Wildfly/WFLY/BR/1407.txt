Correct test methods dependency in EjbMethodInterceptorTestCase
org.jboss.as.test.integration.ejb.interceptor.method.EjbMethodInterceptorTestCase failed intermittently due to dependency of test ordering on https://jenkins.mw.lab.eng.bos.redhat.com/hudson/view/EAP6/view/EAP6-AS-Testsuite/job/eap-60-as-testsuite-RHEL-matrix-openJDK7/lastCompletedBuild/jdk=openjdk-1.7.0-local,label_exp=RHEL6%26%26x86_64/testReport/org.jboss.as.test.integration.ejb.interceptor.method/EjbMethodInterceptorTestCase/testMethodLevelInterceptors/ 
In upstream code, its bean fixed by forcing test running in order, however, the real issue behind is that it assumes testMethodLevelInterceptors() run at first which does not contain variable TopSecretInterceptor.called reset to false at beginning like second test method does.
