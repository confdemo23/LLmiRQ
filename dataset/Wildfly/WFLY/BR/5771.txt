IIOP operations need SerializablePermission("enableSubclassImplementation")
Since JDK 7u25 version org.omg.CORBA_2_3.portable.Output/InputStream classes need extra permissions if Security Manager is enabled. Because of a previous vulnerability, it now checks SerializablePermission("enableSubclassImplementation"). There is a property flag to allow subclass instantiations without the security check (jdk.corba.allowOutputStreamSubclass=true), but this system property is subject to removal in the future Java releases, according to my findings. 
At the moment, our IIOP code fails (can be seen in iiop tests of WildFly testsuite) when running with SM enabled.
