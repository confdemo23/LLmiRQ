Support annotation-property-replacement option in @JMSConnectionFactory, @JMSPasswordCredential
See org.jboss.as.messaging.deployment.JMSContextProducer, getJMSContext. Currently the values in JMSConnectionFactory and JMSPasswordCredential are do not go through the property replacement process. Doing so would be nice in order to externalize configuration settings, e.g.






@Inject




@JMSConnectionFactory("${remoteConnectionFactoryName}")




private JMSContext context;
