The CLI should support property substitution for names of elements and not only for parameters
My customer is using client side substitution in the CLI
jboss-cli.xml:
&lt;resolve-parameter-values&gt;true&lt;/resolve-parameter-values&gt;
This works fine for example with:
/subsystem=datasources/data-source=oracleDS:add(connection-url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@server:1521:ora1, jndi-name=java:/jboss/$
{name}, driver-name=oracle)

The "name" is provided in a property file at the command line for jboss-cli.sh

This request is to extend this behaviour to allow for example:

/subsystem=datasources/data-source=${datasourcename}:add(connection-url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@server:1521:ora1, jndi-name=java:/jboss/${name}
, driver-name=oracle)
In other words, have the actual element name be substituted as well based on a property value
We know the easy workaround is to use bash embedded cli script, so the $
{datasourcename}
 can be provided by a bash variable but it would be nice if the CLI could do that.
