Creating named formater patterns for offline servers fail
After adding and attaching a named formatter to an offline server starting the server fails due to an invalid logging configuration.
server-one fails with:
{{
[Server:server-one] 00:08:00,214 ERROR [org.jboss.as.controller.management-operation] (Controller Boot Thread) JBAS014612: Operation ("add") failed - address: ([
[Server:server-one]     ("subsystem" =&gt; "logging"),
[Server:server-one]     ("console-handler" =&gt; "CONSOLE")
[Server:server-one] ]): java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Formatter "TESTPATTERN" is not found
}}
I assume logging.properties is written too late in LoggingOperations.java
