Cannot disable ConsoleRedirectService
Wildfly Undertow (via org.wildfly.extension.undertow.HostAdd and org.wildfly.extension.undertow.ConsoleRedirectService) redirects all /console/... URL requests (on port 8080/8443) to /console on port 9990.  
This prevents developing or porting applications that themselves need to serve /console/... URLs.
There needs to be a way to disable (in the undertow subsystem configuration) the adding of ConsoleRedirectService by HostAdd.
