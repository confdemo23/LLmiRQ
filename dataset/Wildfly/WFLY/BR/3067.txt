Webservices DUP is not scanning all visible classes for @WebService annotation
Sample use case:  You have a .war in an .ear, and the .war has a web.xml with a &lt;servlet-class&gt; that refers to a JAX-WS endpoint, so the class is annotated with @WebService.  If that class is packaged in a jar found in the ear&amp;apos;s lib directory, the JBossWS DUP won&amp;apos;t pick it up, and then Undertow will throw an error like this:






UT010009: Servlet ClientEndpoint of type class com.redhat.gss.jaxws.ClientEndpoint does not implement javax.servlet.Servlet
