Colocated HA topology with HTTP connectors/acceptors
I try to configure colocated HA topology with HTTP connectors/acceptors but something goes wrong and I see repeated WARN message [1] on the first node and on the second I see the [2]. Maybe it is misconfiguration, but I have no idea what I do wrong. I attached XML configurations of both nodes, please review it.
