Undertow mod_cluster CLI: Display node&apos;s protocol://hostname:port
As a follow up to JBEAP-215, this bug report is a member of a series addressing crucial CLI management capabilities.
Display node&amp;apos;s protocol://hostname:port
At the moment, this is all there is to see:






"balancer" =&gt; {




    "qa_balancer" =&gt; {"node" =&gt; {"worker-2" =&gt; {




        "load" =&gt; 89,




        "status" =&gt; "NODE_UP",




        "context" =&gt; {"/clusterbench" =&gt; {




            "requests" =&gt; 0,




            "status" =&gt; "enabled"




        }}




    }}},




...






Call to action
We need to display node&amp;apos;s connection details, e.g. ajp://karm.brq.redhat.com:8019 or https://192.168.1.100:8009.
I set Blocker priority, because without this information available, it is impossible to test anything more than rudimentary smoke-test scenarios. From the user&amp;apos;s perspective, inability to identify JVMRoutes (node names) with their connection strings renders any larger enterprise setup very hard to manage and maintain.
