Default certificate is generated on server boot
There is change of behavior of "SSL out of box" , AFAICT . Certificate is generated on boot, not on first access as intended. 

It slow down server start.
contradicts WFLYDM0111: Keystore /wildfly-11.0.0.Alpha1-SNAPSHOT/standalone/configuration/application.keystore not found, it will be auto generated on first use with a self signed certificate for host localhost

Steps to reproduce:
1) build wildfly from master
2) unzip fresh distro
3) run ./standalone.sh 
4) certificate is generated

[mchoma@localhost bin]$ ./standalone.sh
