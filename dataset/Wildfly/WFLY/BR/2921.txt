Wrong condition statement in NetworkUtils#formatAddress(InetSocketAddress)
It seems there is a wrong condition statement of formatAddress(InetSocketAddress inet) in the class org.jboss.as.network.NetworkUtils.
https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/blob/master/network/src/main/java/org/jboss/as/network/NetworkUtils.java
This method returns "ipAddress:port", but expected to "hostname:port".
public static String formatAddress(InetSocketAddress inet)
...
// As-is
if(inet.isUnresolved()){
            result.append(inet.getHostName());
// Expected to reversely: 
if(!inet.isUnresolved()){
            result.append(inet.getHostName());
...
