http-listener requires &apos;https&apos; socket-binding
Using a http-listener without the redirect-socket attribute requires the configuration to define a socket-binding with name "https".
The following error is produced attempting to configure wildfly without https:






ERROR [org.jboss.as.controller.management-operation] (Controller Boot Thread) JBAS014613: Operation ("add") failed - address: ([




    ("subsystem" =&gt; "undertow"),




    ("server" =&gt; "default-server"),




    ("http-listener" =&gt; "default")




]) - failure description: {"JBAS014771: Services with missing/unavailable dependencies" =&gt; ["jboss.undertow.listener.default is missing [jboss.binding.https]"]}






I believe this constant is defined in ListenerResourceDefinition on line 80.
If this is the desired behavior, the undertow schema should probably be updated to make redirect-socket required or at least document the dependency.
