org.jboss.as.ejb3.timer.schedule.CalendarBasedTimeoutTestCase#testCalendarBasedTimeout
Running build with smoke tests on current github sources I get failure in this test case.
HOUR_OF_DAY is not 0 as expected but 1.
I changed the Assert in the test case to print out firstTimeout.toString() instead of only timeZoneDisplayName.
See attached files for more.
