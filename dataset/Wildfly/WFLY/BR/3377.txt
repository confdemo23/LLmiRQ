Infinispan cache container statistics configuration does not propagate to caches
This is the continuation of the "WFLY-3106 Infinispan cache statistics cannot be enabled/disabled independently of the cache manager statistics" which fixed the problem of independence of this setting for caches and cache container.
However the side effect is that the cache container settings are now ignored completely and do not propagate to caches.
Technical:
Correctly fixed by WFLY-3106 this cannot be set in defineConfiguration(..) (AbstractCacheConfigurationService) because that works as an override. However, with that fix the value is ignored for caches. The cache&amp;apos;s CacheAdd needs to figure this out from the conainer definition model.
