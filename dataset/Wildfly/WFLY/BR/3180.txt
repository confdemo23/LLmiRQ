OOMs are still possible when using clustered web sessions/SFSBs w/passivation
Currently, the owner of a web session or SFSB is responsible for schedule passivation.  Unfortunately, much to my surprise, infinispan eviction commands are not broadcasted to the cluster, but are local-only.  Consequently, the number of cache entries stored in memory can grow beyond the configured passivation limits, since remote copies of old cache entries are never evicted.
To fix this, we can use the CommandDispatcher to manually broadcast eviction commands to the cluster.
