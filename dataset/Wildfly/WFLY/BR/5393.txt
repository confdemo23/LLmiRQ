Using deprecated attribute use-hornetq-store in CLI does not have any effect being set
Attribute use-hornetq-store was deprecated for EAP7 and use-journal-store should be used instead. But even the attribute is deprecated it still should provide its old functionality.
I think that using use-hornetq-store would have the same effect as when use-journal-store is used.
I would think that when one of the attribute is set then the other one should present the same settings.






/subsystem=transactions:read-attribute(name=use-hornetq-store)




{




    "outcome" =&gt; "success",




    "result" =&gt; false




}




/subsystem=transactions:read-attribute(name=use-journal-store)




{




    "outcome" =&gt; "success",




    "result" =&gt; false




}




/subsystem=transactions:write-attribute(name=use-journal-store, value=true)




{




    "outcome" =&gt; "success",




    "response-headers" =&gt; {




        "operation-requires-restart" =&gt; true,




        "process-state" =&gt; "restart-required"




    }




}









:shutdown(restart=true)




{"outcome" =&gt; "success"}









/subsystem=transactions:read-attribute(name=use-journal-store)




{




    "outcome" =&gt; "success",




    "result" =&gt; true




}




 /subsystem=transactions:read-attribute(name=use-hornetq-store)




{




    "outcome" =&gt; "success",




    "result" =&gt; false




}
