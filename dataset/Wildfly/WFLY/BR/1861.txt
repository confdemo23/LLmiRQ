Zombie web sessions from old cluster members can cause OOM
In the new web session clustering implementation, expiration and passivation are handled locally by the owning node.  If that node leaves, the sessions previously handled by the left node will be rescheduled for passivation/expiration by whichever node next handles that session.  However, any sessions previously handled by the left node that are never accessed again (i.e. zombie sessions) will stay in memory on the remote nodes, since no node ever schedules them for passivation/expiration.  The number of session zombies will continue to grow like a malignant cancer as the cluster membership changes, filling the available memory until there is nothing left to consume...
