CLI: creating a server on a domain slave followed by setting a system property fails when done in batch mode
Setup two boxes:

on one, run domain mode (full-ha) -&gt; domain controller
on the other, configure host.xml to point to the DC, and run the host controller

Now in CLI:

add the group:
/server-group=slaves:add(profile=full-ha,socket-binding-group=full-ha-sockets)


create server and set a prop
batch
/host=slave1/server-config=i1:add(group=slaves,auto-start=false)
/host=slave1/server-config=i1/system-property=env:add(value=dev)
run-batch 

results in:
JBAS010839: Operation failed or was rolled back on all servers.
Debugging (on EAP 6.0.1) showed the real reason:
activeStep.response = (org.jboss.dmr.ModelNode) 
{

     "outcome" =&gt; "failed",

     "failure-description" =&gt; "JBAS010850: No handler for operation

composite at address [

     (\"host\" =&gt; \"slave1\"),

     (\"server\" =&gt; \"i1\")

]",

     "rolled-back" =&gt; true

}
 
More debugging led to :
org.jboss.as.controller.AbstractOperationContext
seems to be where the rollback is set. When debugging, I found that the constructor always sets
     ModelController.OperationTransactionControl transactionControl
but at line 332 (eap 6.0.1) / line 372 (wildfly), the end of doCompleteStep() :
        // Allow any containing TransactionControl to vote
        final AtomicReference&lt;ResultAction&gt; ref = new AtomicReference&lt;ResultAction&gt;(transactionControl == null ? ResultAction.KEEP : ResultAction.ROLLBACK);
and ref becomes a rollback.
I "walked" pretty much of all the code going on in between. The bit where the config is getting persisted is successful.
But I&amp;apos;m afraid I&amp;apos;m out of my depth as there is a lot going on to execute such a composite command
