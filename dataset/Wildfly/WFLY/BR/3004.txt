properties are not resolved for arguments of commands handled on the client-side
When using cli for batch files using --file and --properties arguments, any property is resolved but for those defined in the connect command line.
The properties file contains (among the others):
server.bind.addr = xxxxx
server.management.port = 9990
Having:
connect $
{server.bind.addr}
in the batch file gets
ERROR [org.jboss.as.cli.CommandContext] Failed to resolve host &amp;apos;${server.bind.addr}
&amp;apos;: Failed to create URI: Illegal character in authority at index 16: http-remoting://$
{server.bind.addr}:9990

Having:
connect ${server.bind.addr}
:$
{server.management.port}
gets:
ERROR [org.jboss.as.cli.CommandContext] The port must be a valid non-negative integer: &amp;apos;$
{server.bind.addr}
:${server.management.
If i use literal values for the connect command, any other property in the batch is correctly resolved (but that&amp;apos;s exactly what i was trying to avoid)
