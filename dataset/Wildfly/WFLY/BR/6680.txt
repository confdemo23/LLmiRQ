:read-proxies-configuration and :read-proxies-info fail when at least one of the proxies is unreachable
When the modcluster subsystem is unable to connect to a proxy, the jboss-cli commands :read-proxies-configuration and :read-proxies-info fail with an unhelpful error.
On both the domain controller and application host, :read-proxies-info and :read-proxies-configuration fail with the same error.  This is the output from the application host:






[domain@localhost:9999 subsystem=modcluster] pwd




/host=localhost/server=cluster2/subsystem=modcluster









[domain@localhost:9999 subsystem=modcluster] :list-proxies




{




    "outcome" =&gt; "success",




    "result" =&gt; [




        "web02:8009",




        "web01:8009"




    ]




}









[domain@localhost:9999 subsystem=modcluster] :read-proxies-configuration




{




    "outcome" =&gt; "failed",




    "result" =&gt; undefined,




    "failure-description" =&gt; "JBAS014749: Operation handler failed: newValue is null",




    "rolled-back" =&gt; true




}









[domain@localhost:9999 subsystem=modcluster] :read-proxies-info




{




    "outcome" =&gt; "failed",




    "result" =&gt; undefined,




    "failure-description" =&gt; "JBAS014749: Operation handler failed: newValue is null",




    "rolled-back" =&gt; true




}






In the above example, modcluster was not able to connect to the proxies due to an ssl misconfiguration in the modcluster subsystem in domain.xml.
