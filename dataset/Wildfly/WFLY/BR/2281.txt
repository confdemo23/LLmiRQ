Exception from lifecycle callback interceptor method intercepting a session bean gets suppressed without log message
From EJB spec., "9.3.3 Exceptions from AroundConstruct, PostConstruct and PreDestroy Lifecycle Callbacks", "Table 11" it follows that the container should log the exception or error thrown by a lifecycle callback interceptor method of a session bean or a message-driven bean.
The thrown throwable gets suppressed. However, I cannot find any sign of it in the server log (using default settings - debug level).
I&amp;apos;m not a spec. expert, but I think if the exception is not logged, it should at least not get suppressed. I made some tests that might be of help (available at https://github.com/bafco/wildfly/commits/WFLY-2281) - according to the spec., they probably don&amp;apos;t have to pass.
