ChannelInstanceResourceDefinition doesn&apos;t expose non-primitive fields and any of @ManagedAttribute methods
It seems to me that org.jboss.as.clustering.jgroups.subsystem.ChannelInstanceResourceDefinition#getProtocolMetricResourceDefinition 
doesnt expose ManagedAttributes that would have to be registred as strings
org/jboss/as/clustering/jgroups/subsystem/ChannelInstanceResourceDefinition.java:213
and doesnt expose any of the annotated methods
org/jboss/as/clustering/jgroups/subsystem/ChannelInstanceResourceDefinition.java:208
