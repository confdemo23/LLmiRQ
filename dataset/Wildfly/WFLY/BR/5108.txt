SingletonService can start multiple master nodes if election policies are not identical
Currently, the the singleton master election occurs on every node, and nodes that detect if they have won the election will start the service.  If the election policy is non-deterministic, or not identical on every node, then there is a possibility that multiple singleton services could start.
