Bindings of most binding-types can not be created in naming subsystem configuration in Web Console
When adding bindings in naming subsystem configuration of Web Console, the Add form has wrong mandatory fields. Mandatory fields for bindings are dependent on binding type. 
On the other hand, some binding types do not have attributes that the Add form will try to send to the interface, resulting in user being unable to add any binding type besides external context (for example, adding a simple or lookup binding will result in Unknown error due to simple binding type not being able to have &amp;apos;cache&amp;apos; attribute).
For example, /subsystem=naming/binding=java\:global\/a:add(binding-type=simple, type=int, value=100) would be a legal simple binding inserted through the JBoss CLI:






{"outcome" =&gt; "success"}






Adding this same following binding will produce the following error output in Web Console:
Unknown error
Unexpected HTTP response: 500
