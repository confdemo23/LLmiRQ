can not switch from connector to discovery-group-name for JMS (pooled-) connection factories 
connectors and discovery-group-name are alternative attributes of JMS (pooled) connection factories.
If a resource defines one of this attribute, it must be able to "switch" to the other by running a batch command to:
1. undefine the attribute
2. write the value of the other attribute
This currently does not work:






[standalone@localhost:9999 /] batch




[standalone@localhost:9999 / #] /subsystem=messaging/hornetq-server=default/connection-factory=RemoteConnectionFactory:undefine-attribute(name=connector)




#1 /subsystem=messaging/hornetq-server=default/connection-factory=RemoteConnectionFactory:undefine-attribute(name=connector)




[standalone@localhost:9999 / #] /subsystem=messaging/hornetq-server=default/connection-factory=RemoteConnectionFactory:write-attribute(name=discovery-group-name,value=dg-group1)




#2 /subsystem=messaging/hornetq-server=default/connection-factory=RemoteConnectionFactory:write-attribute(name=discovery-group-name,value=dg-group1)




[standalone@localhost:9999 / #] run-batch




{"JBAS014653: Composite operation failed and was rolled back. Steps that failed:" =&gt; {"Operation step-1" =&gt; "JBAS011630: Alternative attribute of (connector) is already defined."}}
