File upload doesn&apos;t work
In the previous version it worked, but in Beta 1 stopped worked file uploading with PF4 and Mojarra 2.2.3 (neither simple upload didn&amp;apos;t work - tested on blank project, only with PF4 and Apache libs and configured web.xml file)
I get no error in IDE or JS console.
