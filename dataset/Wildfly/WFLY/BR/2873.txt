TestParser cannot marshal empty subsystems
TestParser (used in subsystem test framework) will only marshal if the subsystem&amp;apos;s ModelNode isDefined(). But for simple subsystems with no attributes it doesn&amp;apos;t have to be defined.
It should just check for node existence  parentNode.has(subsystemName)  not whether the node is defined.
