Convert stats-enabled metric into proper statistics-enabled attribute






/subsystem=jgroups/channel=ee:read-attribute(name=stats-enabled)






Other subsystems usually use attribute name statistics-enabled, we should deprecate the current attribute name and support the unified attribute name. This is the case in the transaction subsystem. This issue is similar to JBEAP-6501.
