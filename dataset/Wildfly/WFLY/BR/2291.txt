Bump messaging XML namespace to 2.0
The XML namespace for the messaging subsystem was erroneously bumped from 1.3 to 1.4 for WildFly 8.
This is an error as the 1.x version must be reserved for AS7 7.x releases.
WildFly 8 will use a 2.0 namespace. 
This means that configurations written against WildFly 8.0.0 Alpha and Beta will break once the XML namespace is corrected to 2.0.
