directory-grouping configuration is not getting persisted via CLI when no servers defined

If none of the servers are defined in "host.xml" (means &lt;servers&gt;&lt;/servers&gt; empty tag is present) and if the user tries to run the following CLI command to change the "directory-grouping" to  "by-type"  then the value is not persisted in the configuration file (host.xml) and the &lt;servers&gt;&lt;/servers&gt;  tag is also removed from the host.xml






/host=master/:write-attribute(name=directory-grouping,value=by-type)








The value of "directory-grouping" is stored "in memory" so this change does not survive the host restart.
