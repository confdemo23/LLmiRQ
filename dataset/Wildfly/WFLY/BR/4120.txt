JAX-WS: HandlerChain-Annotation referencing file outside Java Archive causes JBAS015507
Regarding JSR 109, chapter 6.3 the "handler chain file can also be packaged and specified in the annotation such that, it is accessible as a resource from the ClassPath. At runtime, container providers must first try to access the handler chain file as per the locations specified in JSR-181 specification. Failing that, they must try to access it as a resource from the ClassPath."
The JBoss AS Documentation states that "The war is considered to be a single module, so classes defined in WEB-INF/lib are treated the same as classes in WEB-INF/classes. All classes packaged in the war will be loaded with the same class loader" (https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS71/Class+Loading+in+AS7).
Following this statements I think it should be fine to have a HandlerChain-annnotated Webservice within a JAR inside a WAR (WEB-INF/lib) referencing a handler chain file that ist not part of the JAR but resides in WEB-INF/classes. However this situation results in

The implementation of org.jboss.as.webservices.injection.WSHandlerChainAnnotationProcessor seems to expect, that the handler chain file is always part of the ResourceRoot the annotated WebService lives in. With respect to JSR 109 I think that this expectation is wrong and that a handler chain file outside the JAR is a valid scenario.
