ClusteredMessagingTestCase.testClusteredQueue fails intermittently
Originally opened as https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WFLY-4936 but these failures are also to be seen on Linux thus we can rule out ttl problems.
The problem indeed is in using udp stack in CI, we can get reliable results using the tcp stack.
