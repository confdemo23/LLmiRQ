[Migration operation] [Web to Undertow] Default value for access-log extended attribute differs
When migrating access-log without defined extended attribute results in undertow without defined extended attribute, but the default values differ causing that even though in Web subsystem extended format wasn&amp;apos;t used, in Undertow it is expected logging to use extended format.
Ideally the defaults should be the same or the migrate operation needs to define the extended attribute to false if it wasn&amp;apos;t defined in Web.
