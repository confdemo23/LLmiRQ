Undertow &apos;redirect-port&apos; parameter for HTTPS
The main aspect of this feature is to allow the redirect-port configuration other than used in &lt;socket-binding name="https" port="$
{jboss.https.port:8443}
"/&gt;
This is very helpful in production since nobody wants to see the local port -&gt; https://domain.net:8443
