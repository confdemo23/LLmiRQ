AS7BindingRegistry does not respect the SPI contract
The implementation of AS7BindingRegistry#lookup always return null.
This method is called by HornetQ when JNDI entries for its resources
are updated using its own management API.
We advise against using it in WildFly (and use WildFly own management API) but we must still respect the SPI contract for this method.
