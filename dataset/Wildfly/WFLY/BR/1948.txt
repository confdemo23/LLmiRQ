JMXPropertyEditorsTestCase fails on Solaris SPARC
Test org.jboss.as.test.integration.ee.jmx.property.JMXPropertyEditorsTestCase fails on Solaris, because environment variable USER is not set.
From the source:
USER_SYS_PROP = System.getProperty("os.name","linux").contains("indows")?"USERNAME":"USER";
So there is already a differentiation between Windows and others.
For Solaris LOGNAME is the variable to use. And os.name is SunOS.
