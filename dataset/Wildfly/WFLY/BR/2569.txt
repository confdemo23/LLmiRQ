Components in Web and EJB container should always have access to RAR included in the same EAR
See also EE.8.3 Class Loading Requirements.
In the mentioned Arquillian test (servlet protocol) if a class from an EJB module tries to access a class from an RAR you get a NoClassDefFoundError. I also tried to place the class in the WAR with the same result.
