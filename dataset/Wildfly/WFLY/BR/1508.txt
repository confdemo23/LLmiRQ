Transformer builders should not check for rejected operation attributes for the &apos;remove&apos; operation
I came across this while working on WFLY-456 (audit logging) that PR will test for this
The problem is the audit log transformers for jmx are set up to reject if the &amp;apos;enabled&amp;apos; attribute is undefined.
When issuing a &amp;apos;remove&amp;apos; it then looks in the operation for the &amp;apos;enabled&amp;apos; attribute which fails since the operation does not contain that attribute, it is simply:






{




    "operation" =&gt; "remove",




    "address" =&gt; [




        ("subsystem" =&gt; "jmx"),




        ("configuration" =&gt; "audit-log")




    ]




}






The same is true for &amp;apos;read-attribute&amp;apos;
