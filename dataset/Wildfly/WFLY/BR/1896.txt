 The CLI command "module remove" fails to delete non-empty folders
The "module remove" command fails when it deletes non-empty folder.
For instance a resource adapter module contains META-INF/ra.xml file in the module. When I choose to delete the module, it fails:
[standalone@localhost:9999 /] module remove --name=org.jboss.ironjacamar.ra16out 
Failed to delete /home/jcacek/Testing/jboss-eap-6.1.1.ER4/modules/org/jboss/ironjacamar/ra16out/main/META-INF
