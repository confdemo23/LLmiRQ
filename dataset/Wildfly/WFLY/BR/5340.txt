Unable to specify module when specifying custom JACC policy class.
It is currently possible to specify the &amp;apos;javax.security.jacc.policy.provider&amp;apos; system property, however it is not possible to specify a module.
From the JACC specification: -
_For each JRE of a J2EE 1.4 or later version Java EE application server, if the 
system property 
javax.security.jacc.policy.provider
 is defined, 
the application server must construct an 
instance of the class identified by the 
system property, confirm that the 
resulting object is an instance of 
java.security.Policy, 
and set, by calling the 
java.security.Policy.setPolicy
 method, the resulting object as the 
corresponding Policy object u
sed by the JRE. _
The specification only specifies that the system property identifies the class, it does not specify how.  
In it&amp;apos;s simplest form we should assume this is just a class name, in a more complex form we should allow the module to be specified.
