[Migration operation] [Web to Undertow] Migrating https connector in domain fails
When trying to migrate https connector in domain, it fails during creation of security realm, as the operation assumes that security realms are set in domain also under /core-service=management/ but they are set specifically for host =&gt; in case of host master it is /host=master/core-service=management/
