do not revertReloadRequired unless reload was required
HornetQReloadRequiredHandlers will call context.reloadRequired() if there performRuntime method is called and a HornetQ server service is installed.
In turn, it calls context.revertReloadRequired() in their rollbackRuntime if a HornetQ server service is installed.
However it is possible that at boot time, there is not HornetQ server installed when the performRuntime is installed (so context.reloadRequired is not called).
Then if an operation fails at boot time and the HornetQReloadRequiredHandlers op is rolled back, there will then be an installed HornetQ server and  context.revertReloadRequired() will be called.
This generated a NPE before  WFCORE-591 but it is also a programming error to call context.revertReloadRequired() in a OSH if context.reloadRequired() has not been called beforehands
