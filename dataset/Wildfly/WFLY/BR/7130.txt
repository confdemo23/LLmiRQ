PersistenceProperty specified in @PersistenceContext should be passed to the created EntityManager 
While working on the unit test for WFLY-7075, I noticed that PersistenceContext properties are not being passed correctly to the Injected EntityManager, we should fix that.
For Example:

@PersistenceContext(type = PersistenceContextType.TRANSACTION, unitName = "mypc", properties=
Unknown macro: {@PersistenceProperty(name="wildfly.jpa.allowjoinedunsync", value="true")} 
)
private EntityManager allowjoinedunsyncEm;
Is passing an incorrect form of the property values.
