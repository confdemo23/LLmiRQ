Incorrect &apos;Content-Type&apos; response set after executing an erroneous command
The http management interface, upon error, returns an incorrect &amp;apos;Content-Type&amp;apos; of 






&amp;apos;Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8&amp;apos; 






although JSON response is returned.
To reproduce, issue from the command line a simple &amp;apos;read&amp;apos; operation






curl --digest -D - http://localhost:9990/management --header "Content-Type: application/json" -d &amp;apos;{"operation":"read-attribute", "name":"foo"}&amp;apos; -u &lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;









..




Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8




Content-Length: 119

{




    "outcome" : "failed",




    "failure-description" : "JBAS014792: Unknown attribute foo",




    "rolled-back" : true




}






The &amp;apos;Content-Type&amp;apos; should have been set to &amp;apos;application/json&amp;apos; instead of &amp;apos;text/plain&amp;apos;
Note: On JBoss AS 7.1.1.Final, the correct type of &amp;apos;application/json&amp;apos; is returned for the same operation.
