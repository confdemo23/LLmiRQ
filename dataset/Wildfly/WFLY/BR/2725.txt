Class-Path: . can cause JBAS011046: A component named &apos;TestBean&apos; is already defined in this module
&amp;apos;JBAS011046: A component named
&amp;apos;TestBean&amp;apos; is already defined in this module&amp;apos;, I have narrowed it
down to it occurs if they have a jar manifest with Class-Path: .
It looks like when deploying it looks at the jar with the manifest
entry which then must be having it scan the jar containing the EJB
again and failing.
Having the Class-Path: . doesn&amp;apos;t really make sense to me, however it
also seems like we should not be trying to deploy it twice.
It appears ManifestClassPathProcessor ignores the . when the Class-Path is in a jar at the root of an ear but not when the jar is in a war&amp;apos;s WEB-INF/lib
