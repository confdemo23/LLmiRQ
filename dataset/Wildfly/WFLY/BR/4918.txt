Remove default-stack usage and make stack required/explicit per channel
We discussed with Paul earlier today to go the way of making this explicit per channel, since currently there is a info when booting the default ha profiles:
18:06:44,039 INFO  [org.jboss.as.controller.management-deprecated] (ServerService Thread Pool  21) WFLYCTL0028: Attribute &amp;apos;default-stack&amp;apos; in the resource at address &amp;apos;/subsystem=jgroups&amp;apos; is deprecated, and may be removed in future version. See the attribute description in the output of the read-resource-description operation to learn more about the deprecation.
