Log4jCustomHandlerTestCase.disabledLoggerTest does not re-enable the handler
Log4jCustomHandlerTestCase.disabledLoggerTest does not bring the setup back in the original state. This means that whenever defaultLoggingTest is run after disabledLoggerTest, the test fails.
disabledLoggerTest must reset the enabled flag.
