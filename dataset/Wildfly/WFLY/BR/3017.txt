OperationContextImpl.readResourceForUpdate assumes all resources represent persistent config
The readResourceForUpdate impl makes a few assumptions regarding the fact that a given Resource represents persistent config (i.e. Resource.isRuntime() == true):
1) It calls rejectUserDomainServerUpdates() which means an OSH running on a server could not call this.
2) It calls authorize(false, READ_WRITE_CONFIG) which means an OSH for an op available to the RBAC Operator role could not call this.
Places this impacts include LogStoreProbeHandler and LogStoreTransactionDeleteHandler which should be calling readResourceForUpdate but aren&amp;apos;t  and can&amp;apos;t because of this bug.
