Initial calculation of the first expiration time for a scheduled timer is wrong if a start date is set
If a scheduled timer should be created with the following parameters:
ScheduleExpression[second=0 minute=0/5 hour=20-22 dayOfWeek=* dayOfMonth=* month=* year=* start=Thu Jan 14 09:45:35 GMT+1 2016]
The first schedule should be 
  Thu Jan 17 20:00:20 GMT+1 2016
but is calculated as
  Sun Jan 17 20:45:35 GMT+1 2016
The minutes are not correctly set according to the schedule and the given start date.
This happen for seconds/minutes if the ScheduleExpression limit the range.
