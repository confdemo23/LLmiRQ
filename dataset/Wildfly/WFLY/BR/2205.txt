Undeployment prints null
The following is printed during a shutdown of an .ear






11:21:52,260 INFO  [org.jboss.as.server.deployment] (MSC service thread 1-8) JBAS015877: Stopped deployment null (runtime-name: msginflow1_mdb_msginflow_ejb.jar) in 16ms

The &amp;apos;null&amp;apos; part of the .jar undeployment doesn&amp;apos;t look nice.
