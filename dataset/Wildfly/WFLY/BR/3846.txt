JMS resources allows duplicate JNDI entries
The JMS resources that can be stored in JNDI (connection-factory, pooled-connection-factory, jms-queue, jms-topic) does not check whether their list of JNDI entries contains duplicates.
At runtime, duplicates are eliminated but this introduces a difference between the resource model with duplicate entries and its runtime state (without duplicates).
The attribute definitions for their JNDI entries should validate at the MODEL stage that their value does not contain duplicate elements.
