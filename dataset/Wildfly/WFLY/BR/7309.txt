Make the authentication configurable in the testsuite 
Actually some tests cases fails when running against a remote eap instance. 
In this specific case instances running on Openshift v3.
In order to get those tests working we have to modify some classes to configure the authentication.
Example: 
org.jboss.as.test.integration.ee.jmx.property.JMXPropertyEditorsTestCase, had to change this:






    private MBeanServerConnection getMBeanServerConnection() throws IOException {




        final String address = managementClient.getMgmtAddress()+":"+managementClient.getMgmtPort();




        connector = JMXConnectorFactory.connect(new JMXServiceURL("service:jmx:http-remoting-jmx://"+address));




        return connector.getMBeanServerConnection();









    }






To:











    private MBeanServerConnection getMBeanServerConnection() throws IOException {




        HashMap&lt;String, String[]&gt; propEnv = new HashMap&lt;String, String[]&gt;();




        String[] credentials = {  System.getProperty("jboss.management.user",""), System.getProperty("jboss.management.password","") };




        propEnv.put(JMXConnector.CREDENTIALS, credentials);




        final String address = managementClient.getMgmtAddress()+":"+managementClient.getMgmtPort();




        connector = JMXConnectorFactory.connect(new JMXServiceURL("service:jmx:http-remoting-jmx://"+address),propEnv);




        return connector.getMBeanServerConnection();




    }






Could these kind of authentication being configurable?
It is important to us because this allows the tests to be executed against the docker images running in openshift.
