Enhance message WFLYEJB0463 with the name of the defining class
When deploying my ear package now I get messages about wrong transaction attribute for lifecycle methods (see below).
Unfortunately the name of the class where these methods are in is not given.
This should be added to the message for easier locating the problems.
