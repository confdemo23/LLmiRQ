Criteria for triggering @TopologyChanged logic in RegistryFactoryService is wrong
There are 2 issues:
1. In the fast-fail criteria:
if (event.isPre() &amp;&amp; event.getCache().getCacheManager().isCoordinator()) return;
This should be an OR not an AND.
2. The channel coordinator may not have this registry service running!  Determine the "coordinator" based on the value of event.getConsistentHashAtEnd().
This is bug is probably the root cause for a number of a large number of transient failures in the clustering testsuite.
