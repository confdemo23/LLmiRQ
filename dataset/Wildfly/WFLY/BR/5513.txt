EAP7 missing jboss logging internationalization
It is required for EAP7 to contain all features from EAP6.
Per https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ANDIAMO-7, in EAP6 every serious log message (warn, error, fatal) should have a unique code that can be used to identify it.
However, we found 160 serious log messages in EAP7.0.0.DR11 without id.
List of serious log messages without id from a smoke test (link to Jenkins run will be provided when the automated test case is finished):
