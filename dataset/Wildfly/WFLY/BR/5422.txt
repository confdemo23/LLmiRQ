SSO is not destroyed after session timeout period of <distributable/> app.
Using &lt;distributable/&gt; application cause SSO doesnt destroy after session timeout period. Base on [1], there is still active session, what is probably cause that SSO is not destroyed.
Setting similar in EAP6 requires user to login after session timeout period.
Setting priority to critical because of regression with security impacts.
