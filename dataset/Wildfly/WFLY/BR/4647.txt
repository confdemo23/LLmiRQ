RemoteOutboundConnectionReconnectTestCase, EJBClientReconnectionTestCase configured as clustered test cases
In the Wildfly integration testsuite,  manual mode section, there are two test cases which are running in a clustered environment when they should not be:

RemoteOutboundConnectionReconnectTestCase
EJBClientReconnectionTestCase

These two cases test outbound connections from one server A to another server B, and connection from a client to a server A when the server is stopped and started. There is no clustering functionality being tested.
Two problems with this situation:

exceptions are generated in the logs which result from the fact that the test cases are not being run in the correct environment
the fact that the environment is incorrectly configured may also be preventing real bugs from otherwise being detected
