Data sources other than h2 cannot be added to domain servers
This seems to work okay with the h2 driver, but adding a postgres driver add operations fail.
The driver is deployed and is on the main-server-group which defaults to the full profile.






[domain@localhost:9990 /] /server-group=main-server-group:read-children-resources(child-type=deployment,recursive=true,include-runtime=true)




{




    "outcome" =&gt; "success",




    "result" =&gt; {"postgresql-9.4-1201.jdbc41.jar" =&gt; {




        "enabled" =&gt; true,




        "name" =&gt; "postgresql-9.4-1201.jdbc41.jar",




        "runtime-name" =&gt; "postgresql-9.4-1201.jdbc41.jar"




    }}




}






Attempting to add the data source results in the following error:






[domain@localhost:9990 /] /profile=full/subsystem=datasources/data-source=test-pg:add(driver-name=postgresql-9.4-1201.jdbc41.jar, connection-url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:test,user-name=user,password=password, jndi-name=java:jboss/datasources/test-pg)
