"Local" authentication fails when LDAP is used for ManagementRealm
When LDAP is used for authentication in ManagementRealm, "local" authentication, which is enabled in configuration for the realm, appears to stop working.
I have configured my ManagementRealm to use LDAP for authentication of remote clients.  However, I also need to allow local authentication without a username and password, for when jboss-cli is invoked from the command line on the server.  This is needed in order for the wildfly-init-debian.sh script to shut down the server.  I have configured the ManagementRealm as follows:
&lt;security-realm name="ManagementRealm"&gt;
        &lt;authentication&gt;
            &lt;local default-user="$local" /&gt;
            &lt;ldap connection="..." base-dn="ou=accounts,dc=..." recursive="false"&gt;
                ...
            &lt;/ldap&gt;
        &lt;/authentication&gt;
        &lt;authorization map-groups-to-roles="false"&gt;
            &lt;ldap connection="..."&gt;
                ...
            &lt;/ldap&gt;
        &lt;/authorization&gt;
    &lt;/security-realm&gt;
I left out most of the LDAP configuration because I don&amp;apos;t think it is important for this issue.  LDAP authentication works fine for remote clients.  In fact, it works fine for local clients as well--when I invoke jboss-cli with LDAP authentication enabled, it prompts for a username and password; if I enter a valid combination from the LDAP directory, jboss-cli connects successfully and executes its command.
The problem is that I need it to NOT prompt for a username and password when jboss-cli is invoked locally.  Which, I believe, is how things are supposed to work when "local" authentication is also enabled; it just doesn&amp;apos;t work that way when LDAP is enabled for the same realm.
If I comment out the &lt;ldap .../&gt; element in &lt;authentication&gt; for the realm, local authentication starts working again.  I can invoke jboss-cli locally and the command is carried out without a username and password prompt.  Re-enable LDAP, with no other configuration changes, and again it flips back to requiring a username and password.
I have tried replacing "$local" in the @default-user element of the &lt;local&gt; element with a valid name from the LDAP directory, both as a simple username and as a full DN, and jboss-cli still prompts for a username and password.
The modification date on the [tmp/auth] directory changes when I run jboss-cli with LDAP in place and get the username/password prompt, so it appears that the client is putting a token in there to try to use local authentication.  The server just never picks it up.
The documentation specifically mentions that &lt;local/&gt; should work along with &lt;ldap/&gt; here:
