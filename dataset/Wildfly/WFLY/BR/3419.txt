beans in module jars are not discovered except the first jar in module
CDI does not scan module with multiple jars. Only first jar is scanned.
Workaround is to package everything in single jar file.
To reproduce:






#download attached files




#download and unzip wildfly




cd wildfly-9.0.0.Alpha1-SNAPSHOT #or other version &gt; 8.0.0




unzip ../module.multiplejars.zip




cp ../servlet-cdi-test3.war standalone/deployments/




./bin/standalone.sh




# observe deployment fails




# stop server




unzip ../module.ok.zip




./bin/standalone.sh




# observe deployment succeeds






The same scenario succeeds in both cases on EAP 6.2.x.
module.ok.zip was created from module.multiplejars.zip by merging jar files into single one
