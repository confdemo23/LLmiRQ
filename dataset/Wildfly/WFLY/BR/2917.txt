Unhelpful logging related to slave HC failover
In 8.0.0 we introduced the "discovery-options" notion to the HC&amp;apos;s domain-controller config. One expected usage pattern is there will be a master HC and then one or more slaves started with --backup-dc that act as passive failover DC&amp;apos;s. Other slaves will use discovery-options elements to configure all possible masters. If the regular master fails, a backup can be quickly converted to a master with a couple CLI ops.
This works, except the slave shows some unhelpful logging while waiting for the backup to be promoted:

What&amp;apos;s happening there is the slave is connecting to the backup but is not being allowed to register as a slave because the backup is not yet a master. The logging should reflect what&amp;apos;s actually happening.
Also, after the backup is promoted and the slave properly registers, there&amp;apos;s nothing in the slaves logs.
