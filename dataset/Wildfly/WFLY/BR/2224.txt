CLI doesn&apos;t exit batch mode when failures occur in run-batch
If you execute a batch that fails, the CLI remains in batch mode.
[domain@localhost:9990 /] batch
[domain@localhost:9990 / #] /profile=test:add
#1 /profile=test:add
[domain@localhost:9990 / #] :bogus
#2 /:bogus
[domain@localhost:9990 / #] run-batch
JBAS014884: No operation named &amp;apos;bogus&amp;apos; exists at address []
[domain@localhost:9990 / #]
This might be intentional (e.g. to let me fix a typo in my ":bogus" op), but if so, perhaps some output explaining that would be good? And for non-interactive mode staying in the batch seems wrong.
The same problem occurs in the EAP branch, which is where I first noticed it when investigating another issue. In that case the :bogus command wasn&amp;apos;t bogus but was a proper op that failed for legitimate reasons.
