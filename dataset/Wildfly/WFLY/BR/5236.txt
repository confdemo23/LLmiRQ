[Migration operation] [Web to Undertow] SSL configuration - verify client attribute value is not properly migrated
In web there exists different options for verify-client attribute of ssl configuration [1] than values which are allowed to be defined as part of https-listener (REQUIRED, REQUESTED, NOT_REQUESTED).
Currently the migration operation fails as the value isn&amp;apos;t converted to equivalent value accepted by Undertow.

 &lt;xs:attribute name="verify-client" default="none"&gt;




            &lt;xs:annotation&gt;




                &lt;xs:documentation&gt;




                    that is OpenSSL SSLVerifyClient (optional,require,optionalNoCA,none) and clientAuth (true=require/false=none)




                &lt;/xs:documentation&gt;




            &lt;/xs:annotation&gt;




        &lt;/xs:attribute&gt;
