No reload required when add mime-mapping to servlet-container
When mime-mapping is added to servlet container then no reload of server is required, although change takes effect after server restart is performed.
Expected behaivour is either that change takes effect immediatelly after configuration is changed or that server reload is required in response message and result of the operation.
