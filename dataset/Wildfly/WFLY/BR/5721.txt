Some of attributes in datasource subsystem do not allow usage of expressions
Some of the properties in datasource subsystem are disabled to be set by expression. It would be good if all attributes could be set by expression if possible.
Namely these are those which sets "expressions-allowed" as false

driver
	
driver-class-name
driver-module-name
driver-xa-datasource-class-name
module-slot
jdbc-compliant
profile


data-source
	
allow-multiple-users



This issue came alongside with testing EAP7-467 which asks for allowing expressions in datasource subsystem, especially for attribute &amp;apos;enabled&amp;apos;.
