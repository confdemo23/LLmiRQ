Infinispan subsystem ignores cluster name
The Infinispan subsystem uses the name of the cache container as the cluster name, instead of the name configured in &lt;transport cluster="foo"/&gt;.
This is a critical issue when using a gossip router, as only the cluster name determines what nodes form a cluster.
