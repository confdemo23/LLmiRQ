JacORBSubsystemParser should create an OBJECT param for an OBJECT attribute
The parser when parsing "properties" elements is producing a DMR param of ModelType.LIST of ModelType.PROPERTY instead of a param of ModelType.OBJECT, which is how the attribute is specified. This works ok although it results in storing the attribute value in non-canonical format. But this behavior blocks completion of WFCORE-1581 because it results in test failures once WFCORE-1581 is implemented. Tests that compare the model structure generated by a current version controller when it executes the parser&amp;apos;s ops fail as that structure doesn&amp;apos;t match what a legacy version controller produces. The mismatch is largely harmless, but it&amp;apos;s much simpler to correct the parser than to code a workaround into the tests. Plus the parser is just wrong.
