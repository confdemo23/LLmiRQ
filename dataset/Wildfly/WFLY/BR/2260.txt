Vault tests pollute tmp dir
SlaveHostControllerAuthenticationTestCase often fails. On inspection this seems to be that the wrong version of the vault file is being used from the tmp directory.
One way to see this is to clear out the tmp directory, and to run 
$mvn clean install -pl testsuite/domain/  -DallTests -Dtest=org.jboss.as.test.integration.domain.SlaveHostControllerAuthenticationTestCase
a few times, most likely from the second time it will fail. This happens during setup of the test, so you can reproduce more easily by adding a simple class






public class __Throwaway {




   public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception{




       SlaveHostControllerAuthenticationTestCase test = new SlaveHostControllerAuthenticationTestCase();




       test.setupVault();




       test.slaveWithVaultPasswordTest();




   }




}






and adjusting the visiblity of the SlaveHostControllerAuthenticationTestCase
methods. There are also other tests using the vault which also seem to pollute the tmp dir.
