[Migration operation] If acceptor has set factory-class org.hornetq.core.remoting.impl.netty.NettyAcceptorFactory then migration operation does not translate it to Artemis equivalent
This is the same problem as reported with connectors in JBEAP-638.
org.hornetq.core.remoting.impl.netty.NettyAcceptorFactory should be migrated to equivalent org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.remoting.impl.netty.NettyAcceptorFactory.
