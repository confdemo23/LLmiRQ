HTTP Management Interface Content-Type header is broken
Problem:
HTTP Domain Management Interfaces returns invalid Content-Type header:






Content-Type: application/json;utf-8






This breaks management for lots of REST clients.
Proposed solution:
According to W3C and rfc2616 the Content-Type header should be:






Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8






BTW: JBoss 7.1.1 behaviour is ok. It does not send any charset parameter at all.
Example:
Request contains the following headers:






3 &gt; Accept: application/json




3 &gt; Content-Type: application/json




...






Wildfly 8.0.0.CR1 response after digest authentication is:






4 &lt; 200




4 &lt; Authentication-Info: nextnonce="EB9WbpMrUuwNMTM4NzY3MDc2NzAxMgXaHXwaKEWPxbxUj1ihuOg="




4 &lt; Connection: keep-alive




4 &lt; Content-Type: application/json;utf-8




4 &lt; Transfer-Encoding: chunked






JBoss 7.1.1 response after digest authentication is:






4 &lt; 200
