Some web/ejb externalizers are not loading properly
While investigating alternate file cache store options, I noticed that the serialized forms for certain cache keys were unexpectedly large.  Both the org.wildfly.clustering.web.infinispan and org.wildfly.clustering.ejb.infinispan are not importing services from org.jboss.as.clustering.infinispan.  Consequently, the externalizers from these modules are not being loaded properly.  Additionally, ejb cache keys are not properly using the SessionIDExternalizer to serialize SessionID, causing these keys to be larger than they ought to be.
