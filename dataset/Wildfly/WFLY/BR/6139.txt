Starting server with EAP 6.4 standalone-full-ha.xml in --admin-only doesn&apos;t list "web" as legacy






unzip jboss-eap-6.4.0.zip




unzip wildfly-10.0.0.Final.zip









cp jboss-eap-6.4/standalone/configuration/standalone-full-ha.xml jboss-eap-7.0/standalone/configuration/




./wildfly-10.0.0.Final/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full-ha.xml --admin-only






During boot, the server lists threads, cmp, jaxr, messaging and jacorb as legacy:

However, web is missing. IMHO it should be there.
