[Migration][WebToUndertow] Migrating access log valve results always in migration warning
When migrating AccessLogValve it results in printing migration warning for attributes which are not even defined with the valve.
The attributes are: "resolveHosts", "fileDateFormat", "renameOnRotate", "encoding", "locale", "requestAttributesEnabled", "buffered".
Such warning should only be printed for attributes which were actually used with the valve and not when they are actually not used.
