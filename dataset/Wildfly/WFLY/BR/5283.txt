[Migration operation] [Web to Undertow] Connector&apos;s protocol names via FQCN are not recognized as migratable
In Web subsystem there is possible to define protocol either via its API name (e.g. HTTP/1.1, where it is taken default implementation of given API) or via FQCN.
In case of HTTP/1.1 there are several implementations:
JIO =&gt; org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11Protocol - default protocol
NIO2 =&gt; org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol - required to be used to be able to use WebSockets
APR (default with natives) =&gt; org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11AprProtocol
The :migrate operation should also recognize these FQCN as valid HTTP/HTTPS protocols and migrate them correctly.
Note: in case of AJP there are these FQCN:
org.apache.coyote.ajp.AjpAprProtocol - AJP with natives enabled
org.apache.coyote.ajp.AjpProtocol AJP without natives
