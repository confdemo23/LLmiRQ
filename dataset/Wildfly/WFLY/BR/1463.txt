PersistenceUnitService depends on not-yet-available BeanManager
I am getting

The problem is caused by PersistenceUnitServiceHandler.deployPersistenceUnit() which, if the PU is deployed in a CDI-enabled archive, adds a dependency on the BeanManager service. This happens in PersistenceBeginInstallProcessor which executes in the FIRST_MODULE_USE phase.
However, the BeanManager service is not installed by the Weld subsystem until the INSTALL phase.
This can be reproduced easily. Take for example the org.jboss.as.test.integration.jpa.mockprovider.txtimeout.TxTimeoutTestCase and add an empty beans.xml file to the ejb jar (ejbjar.addAsManifestResource(EmptyAsset.INSTANCE, "beans.xml"))
This issue blocks proper Weld integration (implicit bean archives).
