deploy directories not cleaned up
JBoss EAP 6.0.0 (and 6.0.1.ER3) doesn&amp;apos;t clean up it&amp;apos;s tmp/vfs directories.
The following reproduces this -
i) ensure run.conf has the -Xrs set
ii) ensure deployments has a deployable .ear in it
iii) ./run standalone.sh and allow the deployments to deploy
iv) stop the EAP process ie kill &lt;process_id&gt;
v) observe content tmp/vfs
(The -Xrs parameter is used to "-Xrs" to prevent possible interference when JVM is running as a service and receives CTRL_LOGOFF_EVENT or SIGHUP)
This will eventually cause problems with lack of disk space.
Note if the -Xrs parameter content is removed but the tmp/vfs dirs stills exist. This could potentially cause inode problems.
It would be better if there were any additional code so the temp dirs are cleaned up on start up. That would resolve both the -Xrs problem and the excessive dir creation.
