JCA resources model names and service names should be deterministic
This is an offspring of: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WFLY-1492 .
Example RA definition:






&lt;resource-adapters&gt;




    &lt;resource-adapter id="XXX"&gt;




       &lt;archive&gt;test&lt;/archive&gt;




       &lt;transaction-support&gt;NoTransaction&lt;/transaction-support&gt;




    &lt;/resource-adapter&gt;




&lt;/resource-adapters&gt;






The id attribute is optional. This leads to a bit undeterministic model expansion. There are two bits that dont add up or make this a bad apple.
1. RA service names are not unique, despite their model paths, the service name boils down to archive name ( and possibly id if its present). This seems odd, since in model we can point exact, unique path(profile, subsystem,.. and so on).
2. Second thing is the id piece. Its optional. If its not present, AS injects counter suffix( either due to #1 or because there is doubled definition of RA in the same profile). In the end RA paths look like:






/xxx/xxx/xxx/${archive-name}/${archive-name}




/xxx/xxx/xxx/${archive-name}/${archive-name}-&gt;1




/xxx/xxx/xxx/${archive-name}/${archive-name}-&gt;2




/xxx/xxx/xxx/${archive-name}/${archive-name}-&gt;3






With id present:
/xxx/xxx/xxx/$
{archive-name}/${id}

Im not sure ATM, but its even possible to double with id













 /xxx/xxx/xxx/${archive-name}
/$
{id}
-&gt;1
