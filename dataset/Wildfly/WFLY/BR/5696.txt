Mixed domain test launches a broken server from the DC
The host.xml used by the DC in the testsuite/mixed-domain tests is launching a server. This server fails to launch because the profiles being used include stuff that won&amp;apos;t work on current version servers (i.e. legacy subsystems like web).
The failure to launch the server isn&amp;apos;t affecting the test results, proving the existence of the server is not relevant to the test assertions.
However, WildcardReadsTestCase is asserting that the wildcard reads are able to read this server, so we need to decide how to proceed. Simply dropping the "server" element from host.xml doesn&amp;apos;t work.
