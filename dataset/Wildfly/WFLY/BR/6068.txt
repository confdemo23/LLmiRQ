Warn that attribute failback-delay is handled automatically
Attribute failback-delay="6000" is not migrated. 
The migrated configuration should like:






&lt;shared-store-master failover-on-server-shutdown="true" failback-delay="6000" /&gt;






but there is just:






&lt;shared-store-master failover-on-server-shutdown="true" /&gt;
