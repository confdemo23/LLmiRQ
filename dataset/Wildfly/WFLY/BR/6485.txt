add JPA dependency in subdeployments to avoid NPE 
WeldDeploymentProcessor only processes top level deployments (jpa dependencies for subdeployments are skipped). This means that subdeployments that CDI inject a persistence unit/context, will not add a dependency on the JPA PersistenceUnitService. As a result, the PersistenceUnitService is referenced before it is started (which leads to PersistenceUnitService.entityManagerFactory being null).
We should avoid the following NPE by ensuring that dependencies on the JPA persistence unit are added for all sub-deployments.
