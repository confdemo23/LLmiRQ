Inconsistency of elytron security domains mapping
Looking into wildfly-undertow_4_0.xsd and wildfly-ejb3_5_0.xsd .Both undertow and ejb subsystem enables to map deployment security domain to elytron security domain using application-security-domains element. 
However, each in little different way, what could be IMHO misleading. 
Ejb subsystem defines:

name attribute for deployment security domain
security-domain for elytron security domain

Undertow subsystem defines:

security-domain for deployment security domain

Could this be unified? 
Also is it possible mention explicitly in comment in undertow subsystem, that elytron security domain is configured in http-authentication-factory.
