Description of problem:




===









- After failed to deploy, remain deployment information in JBOSS_HOME/{standalone|domaine}/data/content directory 




- Please see following reproduce steps.









How reproducible:




===









Steps to Reproduce:




1. Fail to deploy application via jboss-cli




2. Find deployment info in JBOSS_HOME/{standalone|domaine}/data/content, but there are no standalone.xml in &lt;deployments&gt; tag.




3. Fix deployment and success to deploy.




4. Find "new" deployment info in JBOSS_HOME/{standalone|domaine}/data/content, and the old deployment info will be still there.









- I know that as we changed application in step-3, its hash value was changed. And then, old info is remained in JBOSS_HOME/{standalone|domaine}/data/content. But I think it always happens and should be fixed.









Actual results:









- The deployment information which created when deploy was failed remains in JBOSS_HOME/{standalone|domaine}/data/content.









Expected results:









- The deployment information which created when deploy was failed should be removed if the deploy is failed.
