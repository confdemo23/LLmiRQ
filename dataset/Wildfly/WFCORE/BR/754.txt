EAP fails to start with -bmanagement= option and with specific IP settings
Description of problem:

EAP fails to start with -bmanagement= option. IPv4 address is used in this option.
Host Controller starts to listening on IPv4:9999
Server:server-one probably resolve IPv4 address to host name. Server-one tries to connect to this host name. Hostname is resolved by ping ($ ping dev98) to IPv6 address, where host controller is not listening.
This error doesn&amp;apos;t occur, if hostname is resolved to IPv4 address by ping on machine.
This error doesn&amp;apos;t occur on EAP 6.4.0

How reproducible:

windows

Steps to Reproduce:
Example on dev98 machine:

ssh dev98
ping dev98
