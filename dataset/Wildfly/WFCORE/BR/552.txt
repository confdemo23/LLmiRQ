SaslResource and SaslPolicyResource don&apos;t deal with the parent resource correctly
SaslResource and SaslPolicyResource represent child configuration under a parent connector or http-connector resource. But their handlers (particularly add and remove) do not reflect this. They simply store config changes to the model and return without making runtime changes. So only if they are executed at boot or in a composite with the connector add op is their configuration data properly included in the runtime.
PropertyResource is a similar child of the connector resources, but it uses RestartParentResourceAddHandler, RestartParentWriteAttributeHandler and RestartParentResourceRemoveHandler.
