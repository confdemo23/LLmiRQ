Cannot clone a profile with a remoting subsystem but no io subsystem
The remoting subsystem added a requirement for the new io subsystem&amp;apos;s worker capability, but it has special logic such that the requirement is only added if an endpoint resource is configured. So, legacy configs (pre-io) won&amp;apos;t have that resource, so there is no requirement.
This breaks down in the case of the profile &amp;apos;clone&amp;apos; op, as a placeholder resource we add for the endpoint (to allow reads of the default endpoint config data) ends up getting &amp;apos;described&amp;apos; and added by the cloning process. So that added resource triggers an unmet requirement for the io worker:






[domain@localhost:9990 /] /profile=default:clone(to-profile=test)




{




    "outcome" =&gt; "failed",




    "failure-description" =&gt; {"domain-failure-description" =&gt; "WFLYCTL0369: Required capabilities are not available:




    org.wildfly.io.worker.default in context &amp;apos;profile=test&amp;apos;; There are no known registration points which can provide this capability."},




    "rolled-back" =&gt; true




}






I&amp;apos;m not sure how to deal with this; some sort of marker is needed to disable &amp;apos;describing&amp;apos; that placeholder resource.
