Embedded host controller should set launch type attribute to EMBEDDED
DomainRootDefinition.java always set launch type to 





new LaunchTypeHandler(ServerEnvironment.LaunchType.DOMAIN)





 even if the host controller process is embedded. 
Looking into the LaunchType class, I believe that EMBEDDED value should be used.






    /** The manner in which a server can be launched */




    public static enum LaunchType {




        /** Launched by a Host Controller in a managed domain */




        DOMAIN(ProcessType.DOMAIN_SERVER),




        /** Launched from the command line */




        STANDALONE(ProcessType.STANDALONE_SERVER),




        /** Launched by another process in which the server is embedded */




        EMBEDDED(ProcessType.EMBEDDED_SERVER),




...







Additional info:






./standalone.sh




launch-type              STANDALONE












./domain.sh




launch-type              DOMAIN












[disconnected /] embed-server 




launch-type              EMBEDDED












[disconnected /] embed-host-controller




launch-type              DOMAIN
