Remove n2 model node cloning in ServerOperationResolver
ServerOperationResolver gets called for each operation in a composite.
For each call it clones the configuration model.
It then calls node.asPropertyList() in various spots, which in turn results in a clone of the value of each Property. In particular it does this over the profiles, which means each profile gets cloned.
For very large configurations, this is extremely inefficient. One user was experimenting with adding 1000s of data sources and found it would take over an hour to complete the work. I was able to do it in 30 seconds by correcting these problems.
There are other areas where we may be incurring unneeded expense via calls to node.asPropertyList().
