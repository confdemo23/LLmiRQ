Subsystem deployment undeployed at startup






@BrianStansberry The "mixed approach" doesn&amp;apos;t seem to work any more. https://developer.jboss.org/wiki/ExtendingAS7




@BrianStansberry I&amp;apos;m using this to deploy keycloak WAR from the subsystem.




@BrianStansberry As soon as the server is started, something is calling stopService() on the Keycloak WAR.

@StanSilvert are you still working on AS7? https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/WFLY8/Extending+WildFly+8

@ctomc No. this is WildFly 9. It still works on WildFly 8.

ah the war deployment, that could be regression

@ctomc how so?

@BrianStansberry just reffering that war deployment from subsystem should still work

@StanSilvert what happens? as that thread dump makes no sense

The WAR is simply undeployed as soon as WildFly finishes startup.

@StanSilvert can you give me a link to your code that&amp;apos;s doing the deploy stuff?




Stan Silvert




1:22 PM




just a sec

The code that creates the operation is https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/blob/master/integration




AuthServerUtil ^^^




click on the second link

@StanSilvert are you doing overlay stuff? I see some code there re: overlays




Stan Silvert




1:28 PM




Yes, but not in this instance.




Brian Stansberry




1:28 PM




ok. I&amp;apos;m asking just because that would add more complexity, better scope for some service dependency going missing, triggering stop




Stan Silvert




1:29 PM




For this simple case there are no overlays.




Brian Stansberry




1:29 PM




@StanSilvert interesting, your log looks like it&amp;apos;s a true undeploy op, not just a service stop




Tomaz Cerar




1:30 PM




@BrianStansberry should we use 6.x.0 or 6.x.latest for tranformers testing?




Tomaz Cerar goes get some diner




Stan Silvert




1:30 PM




@BrianStansberry If that&amp;apos;s the case then maybe some condition is triggering my own undeploy operation.




@BrianStansberry I&amp;apos;ll look into that and see what I find.




Brian Stansberry




1:31 PM




@ctomc 6.x.0 is ok by me; chasing CPs is too much hassle




@StanSilvert note this:




13:11:35,294 INFO [org.jboss.as.server] (DeploymentScanner-threads - 1) WFLYSRV0009: Undeployed "main-auth-server.war" (runtime-name: "main-auth-server.war")




the thread -- DeploymentScanner-threads - 1




looks like your deployment is exposed to the scanner?




oh, here&amp;apos;s a guess!




the scanner sees "persistent" =&gt; false and treats it as under scanner control
