 ageout-history does not report failures
When ageout-history cannot delete the old CP files, it silently fails and returns "success".
LocalAgeoutHistoryHandler#recursiveDelete does keep track of whether the
delete failed or succeeded, but the return value from this method is ignored
in execute(...).
If recursiveDelete returns false, it should report a failure.
