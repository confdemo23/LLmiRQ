The "access-mechanism" field in the active-operation resources is always undefined
The "access-mechanism" field in core-service=management/service=active-operations/active-operation=* is always undefined. The code that sets it is using the wrong var:






ModelNode accessMechanismNode = model.get(ACCESS_MECHANISM);




if (accessMechanism != null) {




    accessMechanismNode.set(accessMechanismNode.toString());




}






It should be accessMechanism.toString()
