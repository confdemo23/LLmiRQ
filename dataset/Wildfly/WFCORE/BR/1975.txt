EmbeddedProcessFactory does not accept module pathes with multiple directories
The modulePath parameters passed to the org.wildfly.core.embedded.EmbeddedProcessFactory methods are are rejected if they they are actual paths with multiple directories. Only single directory names are accepted.
This is inconsistent with the normal operation of the server, with the naming of the parameter, as well as with the semantics of the module.path system property that it ultimately sets.
