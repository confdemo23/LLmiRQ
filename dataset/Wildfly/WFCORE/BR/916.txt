 Kerberos authentication into Management Console does not fallback correctly
Fallback management realm is not taken into account for Kerberos authentication into Management Console. In cases when Kerberos authentication to Management Console is configured also with fallback mechanism (properties, security-domain...) and one of:

realm in principal is not set correctly
path to keytab is not set correctly

is set in EAP configuration and when user with valid kerberos ticket tries to access Management Console then fallback is not taken into account and user cant access management console.
