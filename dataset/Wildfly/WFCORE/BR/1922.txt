Use a subsystem to manage configuration changes in the future
Currently configuration-changes are managed as a part of the &amp;apos;kernel&amp;apos; of WildFly Core. Moving this feature to a proper subsystem is more appropriate  as it would provide a nice way to deploy on managed servers according to a profile instead of a host.
Making this subsystem host-enabled we could also just configure it at a host level.
