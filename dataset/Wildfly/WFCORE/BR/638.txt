deployment runtime-name mismatch between content repo and server-group and logs
We are continuously deploying web applications (wars) into our wildfly domain as part of our continuous deployment driven by Bamboo.
Each time an application build succeeds it will trigger a deployment to our wildfly domain.
If this is the first deployment we run this command.






jboss-cli.sh --connect --controller=somehost:9990 --user=admin --password=admin --command="deploy app-0.1-SNAPSHOT.war --name=app.war --runtime-name=app-0.1-SNAP\




SHOT-b1.war --server-groups=A






For subsequent deployments we force a redeploy over existing deployment.






jboss-cli.sh --connect --controller=somehost:9990 --user=admin --password=admin --command="deploy app-0.1-SNAPSHOT.war --name=app.war --runtime-name=app-0.1-SNAP\




SHOT-b2.war --force




jboss-cli.sh --connect --controller=somehost:9990 --user=admin --password=admin --command="deploy app-0.1-SNAPSHOT.war --name=app.war --runtime-name=app-0.1-SNAP\




SHOT-b3.war --force




jboss-cli.sh --connect --controller=somehost:9990 --user=admin --password=admin --command="deploy app-0.1-SNAPSHOT.war --name=app.war --runtime-name=app-0.1-SNAP\




SHOT-b4.war --force




etc....






Since upgrading to WildFly 8.2.0 we see a strange behaviour in the domain management web console (http://somehost:9990/console/App.html#domain-deployments).
The application runtime name in content repository is not the same as what is shown in the server group.
I will attach screenshots for an app named apollo.war. You will see from the screenshots that the content repository shows runtime name=apollo-0.1.12-SNAPSHOT-11\
03.war, but the
server group shows runtime-name=apollo-0.1.12-SNAPSHOT-1045.war. (The last number in runtime-name is the build number from bamboo)
The server.logs from wildfly show "Deployed "apollo.war" (runtime-name : "apollo-0.1.12-SNAPSHOT-1045.war")"
However, we can tell by app capabilities that what is really deployed is apollo-0.1.12-SNAPSHOT-1103.war.
We are totally confused by this discrepency.
