Property separator not appended after argument value if argument completer uses non-zero offset
For example:
module add --name=foo --dependencies=sun.scripting ==&gt; space character is added at the end.
module add --name=foo --dependencies=sun.scripting,sun.jdk ==&gt; Nothing happens, no space character added.
deployment-overlay add --name=foo --contents=foo=/some/file&lt;TAB&gt; ==&gt; Nothing happens, no space character added.
This seems to be caused by a condition in  OperationRequestCompleter - if a suggested value is the same as current user input, ORC replaces the suggestion with a separator.
This only works if the offset returned by argument completer is 0 - if the completer provides only part of the value, this condition will never be triggered.
