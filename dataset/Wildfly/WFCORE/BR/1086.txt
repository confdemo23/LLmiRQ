ManagementResourceRegistration.getCapabilities() does not account for override models
ManagementResourceRegistration.getCapabilities() is implemented by simply reading the local state of ConcreteResourceRegistration. It needs to work like getAttributeNames(), by delegating to the root node which in turn uses NodeSubregistry to combine data from any singleton override registration and the corresponding wildcard registration.
