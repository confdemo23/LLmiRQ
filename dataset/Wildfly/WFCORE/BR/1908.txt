Tab completion suggest writing attribute which has access type metric and is not writable
CLI tab completion suggests attributes that are not writable and their access-type is metric
Example 





/subsystem=messaging-activemq/server=default/jms-queue=DLQ:write-attribute(name=&lt;TAB&gt;




consumer-count  delivering-count  entries  legacy-entries  message-count  messages-added  scheduled-count  






From executing :read-resource-description we can see, attributes consumer-count, delivering-count, message-count, messages-added, scheduled-count are of type metric.
On attempt to write metric attribute, for example message-count, non writable error is printed 





[standalone@localhost:9990 jms-queue=q] :write-attribute(name=message-count, value=5)




{




    "outcome" =&gt; "failed",




    "failure-description" =&gt; "WFLYCTL0048: Attribute message-count is not writable",




    "rolled-back" =&gt; true




}






CLI should not suggest writing attributes that are not writable.
