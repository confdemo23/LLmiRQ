Saved rollout-plan &apos;name&apos; or &apos;id&apos; attribute discrepancy
When using rollout plans for EAP deployment scenarios I can create my own named rollout-plan for ease of use. I can then apply rollout command later on, referring with name of my own rollout plan that should be used. There is minor discrepancy in the way I create and use such rollout plan though.
When I create rollout-plan, I use command like:






rollout-plan add --name=my-rollout-plan --content={rollout main-server-group(rolling-to-servers=false,max-failed-servers=1),other-server-group(rolling-to-servers=true,max-failure-percentage=20) rollback-across-groups=true}







see --name attribute given to name my rollout plan

When I then refer to it I use following command:






deploy /path/to/test-application.war --all-server-groups --headers={rollout id=my-rollout-plan}







see id attribute given to rollout header operation

Yes, this is really minor issue, but I think that these two attributes used in aforementioned commands should be unified (preferably to name instead of id) as user might be confused when using it.
Note: examples are used from our documentation.
Note: I do not know whether I am missing something but I was not able to retrieve more info how to use rollout header operation in deploy command directly in CLI.
