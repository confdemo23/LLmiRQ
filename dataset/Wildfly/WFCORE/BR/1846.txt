WFLYSRV0153 error after attempting to explode archived subdeployments of archived deployments
In archived deployments with archived subdeployments, the explode operation with path parameter defined to point at archived subdeployment causes the removal of whole deployment from the content repository. 
This operation is illegal, but the server should produce formed warning message with operation failing gracefully instead of throwing stack trace in this case.
