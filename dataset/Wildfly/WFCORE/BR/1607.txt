Removing children of security-realm always finishes with {"outcome" => "success"}
Removing children of security-realm (e.g. authentication) always finishes with 
{"outcome" =&gt; "success"}
. This happens even if type of children of security-realm does not exist in server configuration. It should rather finish with failure to indicate that nothing was removed.
