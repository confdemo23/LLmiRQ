CLI gets fooled by early connection
CLI in confused by early connection to domain which is booting. CLI acts as I was connected to the standalone instance, some high level commands are not executable.






[pkremens@dhcp-10-40-5-149 bin]$ ./domain.sh




...




# run while domain is booting




[pkremens@dhcp-10-40-5-149 bin]$ ./jboss-cli.sh -c 




[standalone@localhost:9999 /]









# domain has fully booted









[standalone@localhost:9999 /] ls -l




ATTRIBUTE                VALUE                 TYPE   




launch-type              DOMAIN                STRING




...




[standalone@localhost:9999 /] shutdown --host=master




--host is not allowed in the standalone mode.
