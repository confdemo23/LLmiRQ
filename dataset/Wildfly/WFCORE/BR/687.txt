patches with duplicate element patch-id values should be rejected
Patches that contain duplicate patch-id attribute values in &amp;apos;element&amp;apos; elements in patch.xml can be applied but can&amp;apos;t be rolled back.  An attempt to rollback such a patch will result in an error "Content loader already registered for patch " + patchID, thrown from IdentityPatchContext.recordContentLoader(patchID, contentLoader).
Current implementation should reject patches with duplicate element patch-id values (unless the value is &amp;apos;base&amp;apos;).
Adding support for duplicate element patch-id values is a more difficult task at this point. If we decide to support it after all, it&amp;apos;ll be implemented under a different issue.
