ConfigurationChangeResourceRemoveHandler makes its changes in the constructor not in execute
ConfigurationChangeResourceRemoveHandler is calling ConfigurationChangesCollector.deactivate() in its constructor. So deactivate gets called at early boot when the ConfigurationChangeResourceDefinition class gets loaded and the maxHistory is still 0, but never thereafter.
A reload won&amp;apos;t cause it to get called again either, as ConfigurationChangeResourceDefinition is only constructed when the static INSTANCE member is initialized.
