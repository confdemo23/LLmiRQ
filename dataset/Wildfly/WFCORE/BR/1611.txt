CLI could stuck if SIGINT is send during authentication dialogue
Interruption a CLI session with Ctrl+C during authentication dialogue could get CLI into unresponsive state.
reproduce
Either use a remote server, --no-local-auth cli script arg or remove a local element from ManagementRealm configuration






         &lt;security-realms&gt;




             &lt;security-realm name="ManagementRealm"&gt;




                 &lt;authentication&gt;




-                    &lt;local default-user="$local" skip-group-loading="true"/&gt;






start a standalone server and launch a CLI






[pkremens@localhost] $ ./standalone.sh &amp;




[pkremens@localhost] $ ./jboss-cli.sh




[disconnected /] connect




Authenticating against security realm: ManagementRealm




Username: &lt;Press Ctrl+C here&gt;






Could not connect message is printed, but process is not terminated and stuck at this point.






The controller is not available at localhost:9990: java.net.ConnectException: WFLYPRT0023: Could not connect to http-remoting://localhost:9990. The connection timed out: WFLYPRT0023: Could not connect to http-remoting://localhost:9990. The connection timed out






Only way to recover the terminal is to SIGKILL the CLI process.
