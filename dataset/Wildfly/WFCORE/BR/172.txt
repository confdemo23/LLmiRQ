Wrong application name used for Syslog logging
The auditlog code uses "WildFly Full" value as an application name (APP-NAME header field) for syslog logging. 
It&amp;apos;s not allowed to use space in the value, because the space is a header field separator in syslog messages. Look at syslog message format - http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424#section-6
