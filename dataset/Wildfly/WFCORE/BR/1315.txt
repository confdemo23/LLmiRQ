Double prompt when connecting to a new HC
I observed this with 0.66.3 in a kind of franken-build of EAP 7. The logical equivalent would be 2.0.8.Final once WFCORE-1277 is fixed.






[domain@localhost:9990 core-service=discovery-options] connect 127.0.0.1:29990




[disconnected core-service=discovery-options] [domain@127.0.0.1:29990 core-service=discovery-options] cd /




[domain@127.0.0.1:29990 /]






Before the first line I had killed the HC at localhost:9990, so then I wanted to connect to another HC. Got a double prompt.
Not a big deal, but I wanted to record it.
