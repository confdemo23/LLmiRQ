Reloading host-controller via http-api puts the HC into unresponsive state
Reloading host-controller via http-api puts the HC into unresponsive state.
reproduce
 - create an administrative user admin:asdasd@2
 - start a domain
 - reload a server via http api






curl --digest -L -D - http://localhost:9990/management --header "Content-Type: application/json" -d &amp;apos;{"operation":"reload","name":"", "address":{"host" : "master"},"json.pretty":1}&amp;apos; -u admin:asdasd@2






actual
Default server instances are stopped, HC is left in unresponsive state.
Keeping the domain alive, following message will appear in 5 minutes, domain will become responsive again after that.






[Host  Controller] 04:47:23,966 ERROR  [org.jboss.as.controller.management-operation] (management task-7)  WFLYCTL0349: Timeout after [300] seconds waiting for service container  stability while finalizing an operation. Process must be restarted. Step  that first updated the service container was &amp;apos;reload&amp;apos; at address  &amp;apos;[("host" =&gt; "master")]&amp;apos;






expected
Domain is reloaded
additional info
The issue was introduced by fix for JBEAP-2751 - https://github.com/jbossas/wildfly-core-eap/commit/4986773a51fbf43ad911aecc403f7eb90e72a8c2

I am unable to reproduce locally, but issue can be easily reproduced on slower servers in MWQE lab. SSLMasterSlave*WayTestCase using reload via http-api cousing failures in domain modules of wf-core testsuite (e.g. eap-7x-as-testsuite-test-core-rhel )
Regression against 7.0.0.ER4. I was able to reproduce with the latest wildfly-core bits as well (1be598e)
