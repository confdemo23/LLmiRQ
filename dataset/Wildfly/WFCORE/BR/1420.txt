CLI shutdown command doesn&apos;t support graceful shutdown
The shutdown command needs to support a timeout param so users can have a graceful shutdown.
I&amp;apos;m calling this a bug because the low level :shutdown op is not reliable for CLI users due to the issues with handling of connection closing that the shutdown command takes care of.
