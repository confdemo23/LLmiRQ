ListModuleRootsHandler and ModuleLocationHandler don&apos;t handle PrivilegedActionException properly
The two inner class OSHs in ModuleLoadingResourceDefinition don&amp;apos;t deal with exceptions properly. They invoke AccessController.doPrivileged and then deal with any PrivilegedActionException by rethrowing as OperationFailedException.
OperationFailedException represents a client mistake and is handled as such (e.g. isn&amp;apos;t logged in the server log.) It shouldn&amp;apos;t be thrown here unless the PrivilegedActionException.getCause() value is itself an OFE. Otherwise, the OSHs should throw a RuntimeException.
