Not started servers need a placeholder resource when added
In ServerAddHandler where the server resource is created, a placeholder should be added. I.e. instead of context.createResource(...) below
        context.addStep(runningServerAdd, new OperationStepHandler() {
            @Override
            public void execute(final OperationContext context, final ModelNode operation) throws OperationFailedException 
{

                context.createResource(PathAddress.EMPTY_ADDRESS);

                context.stepCompleted();

            }
        }, OperationContext.Stage.MODEL, true);
context.addResource(PathAddress.EMPTY_ADDRESS, PlaceholderResource.INSTANCE) should be used instead. Otherwise, servers that are not started at boot will be missing runtime proxies and will be considered as parts of the persistent model.
