Unhelpful error message when OSH throws an exception with no detail message
This shows up a fair amount in issue reports, either in the CLI output or in the server log:
"failure-description" =&gt; "JBAS014749: Operation handler failed: null"
The null happens because the message is getting passed the result of throwable.getLocalizedMessage() and that may be null. See DMR-11 for what&amp;apos;s likely the most common reason it&amp;apos;s null.
If it&amp;apos;s null, the code should use the class name of the error message.
