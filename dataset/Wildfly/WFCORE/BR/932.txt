stop-embedded-server stops the embedded host controller and vice versa
We have four new commands for controlling the lifecycle of embedded instances:

embed-server - launch embedded standalone
stop-embedded-server - stop embedded standalone
embed-host-controller - launch embedded host
stop-embedded-host-controller - stop embedded host


I am able stop embedded standalone by stop-embedded-host-controller and embedded host controller by stop-embedded-server.






[disconnected /] embed-server 




[standalone@embedded /] stop-embedded-host-controller 




[disconnected /] embed-host-controller 




14:22:18,781 INFO  [org.jboss.modules] (AeshProcess: 15) JBoss Modules version 1.4.3.Final




[domain@embedded /] stop-embedded-server 




[disconnected /]







A question comes to my mind, do we need two commands for stopping the embedded instance?
