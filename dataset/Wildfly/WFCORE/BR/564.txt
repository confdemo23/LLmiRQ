setXmlWrapperElement() doesn&apos;t work properly with multiple resource children






Jeff Mesnil 12:13 @ctomc hi tomaz. The setXmlWrapperElement() method in persistent xml builder API is supposed to add a XML wrapper around all the resource&amp;apos;s XML elements, right? and not around each resource element.




ie it looks like &lt;wrapper&gt;&lt;res /&gt;&lt;res /&gt;&lt;/wrapper&gt; and not &lt;wrapper&gt;&lt;res /&gt;&lt;/wrapper&gt;&lt;wrapper&gt;&lt;res /&gt;&lt;/wrapper&gt;




Tomaz Cerar 12:17 hmm, you are right also around resources




it would be &lt;wrapper&gt; &lt;res /&gt; &lt;res/&gt; &lt;/wrapper&gt;




just remembered i had that in 1.0 xsd of undertow subsystem




Jeff Mesnil 12:20 yes, I want to wrap some resources (eg queue) in a wrapper (&lt;queues&gt;). But the persistent XM parser is broken (it wants one wrapper around each resource)




the XML persister is working as expected though




Tomaz Cerar @jmesnil you are right it is broken, i can reproduce it also on undertow-1.0.xml test case




i just had one resource under it so it passed
