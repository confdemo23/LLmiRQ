RemoteDomainConnectionService uses out of date HostInfo data when reconnecting
When RemoteDomainConnectionService starts, it calculates a "hostInfo" ModelNode that among other things includes data about what addresses the host is ignoring, and what server groups and socket binding groups are relevant to it if it is ignoring resources unrelated to its servers.
Problem is, this data is never updated if the host&amp;apos;s config changes, so if the host needs to reconnect to the master, it sends out-of-date data to the master, and also uses out of date data to process the info that comes back from the master.
We need to figure out how to refresh that data for each connection to the master.
