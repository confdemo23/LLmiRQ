Don&apos;t store state in InMemoryAuditLogHandlerResourceDefinition
https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-core/pull/890#discussion_r35354989
 private static final Map&lt;String, InMemoryAuditLogHander&gt; histories = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap&lt;String, InMemoryAuditLogHander&gt;());
We don&amp;apos;t want to delay merging this PR for this, but once it&amp;apos;s merged please send up a PR to make this a non-static field and have the InMemoryAuditLogHandlerResourceDefinition pass a ref to it to the handlers when it constructs them.
Having this be static is no big deal in this case, but I don&amp;apos;t want anyone looking at kernel code and thinking that using static fields to store state is a good practice.
