Graceful shutdown is interfering with the &apos;kill&apos; and &apos;destroy&apos; operations
The &amp;apos;kill&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;destroy&amp;apos; operations on the HC are meant to force shutdown of misbehaving servers. But the graceful shutdown work ([1]) has introduced a management op into the mix. I believe that should be removed, as its not the intent of these operations to try and be graceful; the regular &amp;apos;stop&amp;apos; ops are for that.
When experimenting with how domains react to OOME servers as part of my WFCORE-378 work I&amp;apos;m seeing &amp;apos;kill&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;destroy&amp;apos; no longer function because the OOME on the server means the graceful shutdown management op hangs.
