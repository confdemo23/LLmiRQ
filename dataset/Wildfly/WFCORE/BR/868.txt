CLI if/else is not handling special characters strings with parenthesis
When using CLI if-else scripting that uses a string that contains parenthesis it fails with the following message:
Failed to handle &amp;apos;if (outcome == success &amp;&amp; result.value != "a64180c0)e7187af86b435229de904104") of /system-property=test:read-resource&amp;apos;: Unexpected operation at 49 in &amp;apos;(outcome == success &amp;&amp; result.value != "a64180c0)e7187af86b435229de904104")&amp;apos;
