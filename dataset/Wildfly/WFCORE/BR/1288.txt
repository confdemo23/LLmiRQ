installing CP over one-off fails if the modules patched by the one-off are not patched in the CP
If a CP is installed over active one-off patches, the patch application may fail if the CP does not contain updates for the modules that were patched by the one-offs.
Normally, CP patches accumulate the one-off patches released since the previous CP which is, probably, why this bug has not been discovered for a long time.
