ManagedSocketFactory doesn&apos;t work for client sockets
SocketBindingManagerImpl does not work with client sockets.
It adds sockets to a map based on local address.  Client sockets that have not been bound yet do not have a local address.
This breaks the JGroups subsystem&amp;apos;s ManagedSocketFactory, which uses SocketBindingManagerImpl for both server and client sockets.
