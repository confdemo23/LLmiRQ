Fix double redeployment due to .failed file and a artifact with newer timestamp.
Issue found and described in https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1169239
steps to reproduce:
1. deploy a "Test.war"
2. Change something in "Test.war" to fail it.
3. "Test.war.failed" file will be created.
4. stop JBoss EAP.
5. Revert the changes done in "Test.war" so that it will deploy successfully. 
6. Now there are two files ("Test.war.failed" and "Test.war", due to correction, Test.war must have a newer timestamp than Test.war.failed)in deployment directory. 
7. Restart JBoss EAP, it will fail with below Error :
The problem happens as a result of redundant redeployment in next reboot. During servert reboot, it will try to redeploy the application due to found .failed file, it also will try to redeploy same application because Test.war has a newer timestamp to see the problem. This will cause server startup failure as:






ERROR [org.jboss.as.controller.management-operation] (ServerService Thread Pool -- 18) JBAS014613: Operation ("add") failed - address: ([("deployment" =&gt; "Test.war")]) - failure description: "JBAS014803: Duplicate resource [(\"deployment\" =&gt; \"Test.war\")]
