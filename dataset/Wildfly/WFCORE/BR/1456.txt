org.jboss.as.cli.scriptsupport.CLI prevents use of embed-server and embed-host-controller
The org.jboss.as.cli.scriptsupport.CLI will throw an exception if the user invokes the cmd method before invoking one of the connect methods. But the connect/disconnect methods are oriented toward remote connections. The result is you can&amp;apos;t really use this class with the offline CLI.
I&amp;apos;m not sure what the best fix is here. Perhaps new method(s) analogous to connect/disconnect that establish a CommandContext but don&amp;apos;t call connectController(). Or perhaps the checkNotConnected() call in the cmd method should just be dropped, and an unconnected command context created. But then the existing connect/disconnect methods would need to be reworked to deal with the fact that an unconnected command context may be present.
