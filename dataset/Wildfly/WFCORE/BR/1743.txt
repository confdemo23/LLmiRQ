Unable to force CLI to execute a low level command
I cannot get this operation to execute, even if I set validate-operation-requests to false in jboss-cli.xml:






[standalone@embedded /] /subsystem=datasources/bogus=*:read-resource-description




Failed to get the list of the operation properties: "WFLYCTL0030: No resource definition is registered for address [




    ("subsystem" =&gt; "datasources"),




    ("bogus" =&gt; "*")




]"






It is important that the CLI allows users to send whatever low level ops they wish to the server if they turn off verification. The server validates requests itself, and in some cases can be coded to be lenient about things (e.g. to let previous &amp;apos;wrong&amp;apos; things work.) We don&amp;apos;t want the CLI to get in the way of that by doing client side validation that cannot be turned off.
Problem seems to be this in the Util class:






    public static ModelNode toOperationRequest(CommandContext ctx,




            ParsedCommandLine parsedLine, Attachments attachments)




            throws CommandFormatException {




        return toOperationRequest(ctx, parsedLine, attachments, true);




    }






That &amp;apos;true&amp;apos; param results in the CLI trying to do a background read-operation-description and failing the op if unsuccessful.
