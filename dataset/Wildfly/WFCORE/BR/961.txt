CapabilityRegistryResourceDefinition provides inconsistent ordering of output
The output from CapabilityRegistryResourceDefinition is inconsistently ordered. We want consistent output between reads.
The RegistrationPoints are stored in CapabilityRegistration in a LinkedHashSet, but when they are provided to CapabilityRegistryResourceDefinition they get put in a plain HashSet.
The capabilities themselves are not stored in any order, but when provided to CapabilityRegistryResourceDefinition they could be ordered.
