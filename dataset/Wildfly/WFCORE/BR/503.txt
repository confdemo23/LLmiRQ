Child resources under the deployment=XXX resource should be marked as runtime-only
Underneath a deployment resource there can be a large tree of runtime-only resources. Those resources are not getting the correct value for their isRuntime() property.
DeploymentModelUtils.getOrCreate() should call Resource.Factory.create(true) instead of just Resource.Factory.create().
Note this may break the console if it is doing a recursive read of deployment resources and not including the include-runtime=true param.
