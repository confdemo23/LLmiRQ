ResourceBuilderRoot drops data when integrating an externally created child ResourceDefinition
ResourceDefinitionRoot&amp;apos;s impl of pushChild(ResourceDefinition child) is doing an incomplete integration of the data from &amp;apos;child&amp;apos;. It drops everything except attributes, operations and children, losing capabilities and other misc data.
I found this will developing tests for WFCORE-1106.
