ConfigurationFile does invalid reload when special config file names are specified
ConfigurationFile records the value passed by -c or --[server|host|domain]-config and uses it to determine the boot file to use whenever it needs to boot. This is ok during initial boot, but it reuses it during reloads.
This breaks down when specials values like "initial", "boot", "v1" or some snapshot are used. The reload ends up reading from the original file again, not from the latest persisted one, and any changes made are lost.
