Memory leak in JBoss CLI
The JBoss CLI contains a memory leak related to CLI Kerberos authentication.
The org.jboss.as.cli.impl.CommandContextImpl class calls the initJaasConfig() in its constructor, 
which adds a new JaasConfigurationWrapper instance to javax.security.auth.login.Configuration.
It&amp;apos;s done for every new CommandContext instance, so it consumes more and more memory. There is no cleanup for the registered 
configurations.
Moreover, the searches for appropriate 
login config take more and more time because they have to go through all the wrapped objects.
