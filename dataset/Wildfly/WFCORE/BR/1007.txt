Warnings about missing notification descriptions when an operation removes an extension
When I use migration operation the console log is filled with warning messages of type
WARN  [org.jboss.as.controller] (management-handler-thread - 1) WFLYCTL0357: Notification of type resource-removed is not described for the resource at the address [("subsystem" =&gt; "jacorb")]
This is the same either for jacorb or web or messaging subsystem. If I do the sequence of operation






[standalone@localhost:9999 /] /subsystem=jacorb:migrate()




{




    "outcome" =&gt; "success",




    "result" =&gt; {"migration-warnings" =&gt; []}




}




[standalone@localhost:9999 /] /subsystem=messaging:migrate()




{




    "outcome" =&gt; "success",




    "result" =&gt; {"migration-warnings" =&gt; []}




}




[standalone@localhost:9999 /] /subsystem=we




web  webservices  weld  




[standalone@localhost:9999 /] /subsystem=web




web  webservices  




[standalone@localhost:9999 /] /subsystem=web:migrate()




{




    "outcome" =&gt; "success",




    "result" =&gt; {"migration-warnings" =&gt; []}




}






then I the log looks like

I think that the migration operation should not show those warnings.
