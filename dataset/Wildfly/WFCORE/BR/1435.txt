Users with low privileges can see logged operations they shouldn&apos;t be able to see
If a SuperUser performs for example this:






/core-service=management/access=audit/in-memory-handler=y:add   




/core-service=management/access=audit/in-memory-handler=y:write-attribute(name=max-history,value=50)






then a Monitor user shouldn&amp;apos;t be able to see this in the configuration change log (as decided in EAP7-89), because he doesn&amp;apos;t even have the permission to "read" the manipulated resource.. But actually he can see it:






/core-service=management/service=configuration-changes:list-changes




{




    "outcome" =&gt; "success",




    "result" =&gt; [




        {




            "operation-date" =&gt; "2016-03-15T08:40:25.807Z",




            "access-mechanism" =&gt; "NATIVE",




            "remote-address" =&gt; "127.0.0.1/127.0.0.1",




            "outcome" =&gt; "success",




            "operations" =&gt; [{




                "operation" =&gt; "write-attribute",




                "address" =&gt; [




                    ("core-service" =&gt; "management"),




                    ("access" =&gt; "audit"),




                    ("in-memory-handler" =&gt; "y")




                ]




            }]




        },




        {




            "operation-date" =&gt; "2016-03-15T08:40:25.809Z",




            "access-mechanism" =&gt; "NATIVE",




            "remote-address" =&gt; "127.0.0.1/127.0.0.1",




            "outcome" =&gt; "success",




            "operations" =&gt; [{




                "operation" =&gt; "add",




                "address" =&gt; [




                    ("core-service" =&gt; "management"),




                    ("access" =&gt; "audit"),




                    ("in-memory-handler" =&gt; "y")




                ]




            }]




        }




    ]
