WFLY won&amp;apos;t startup due to "WFLYCTL0212: Duplicate resource [(\"deployment\" =&gt; \"xxx.war\")]"
If you firstly deploy a .war application by CLI command, then deploy 2nd time same .war application by copying it to /depolyment directory. After server restart, it shows:






15:26:26,913 INFO  [org.jboss.as] (MSC service thread 1-8) WFLYSRV0049: WildFly Full 9.0.0.Alpha2-SNAPSHOT (WildFly Core 1.0.0.Alpha15) starting

steps to reproduce:
1. start wildfly and deploy a .war application by CLI.
2. copy same .war application to /deployment directory
3. restart wildfly to see the error message. 
This happens because step 2 does a "full-replace-deployment" operation which does not remove content from standalone/data/content/aa/2d0425dd53572294d591b56efdee2680539eaf/content and deployment info from configuration file(standalone.xml). Therefore, you will have xxx.war in standalone/data/content and configuration file(standalone.xml), also a xxx.war and xxx.war.deployed file inside /standalone/deployments. A second time server restart will cause a duplicate resource error.
