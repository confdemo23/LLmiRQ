System properties are broken in domain mode
There seems to be some weirdness in how system properties are being propagated to domain mode servers, and in many cases they are not being applied. 
This appears to be an issue with the boot time handling of system properties.
The only way I could get the property to be applied was to start the server first, then add the property using boot-time=false, although even in this case the property will disappear if the domain is restarted or the server is reloaded.
