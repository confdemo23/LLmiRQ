Deployments from the domain/data/content folder goes missing after few minutes if the Host controller is started with --backup option.
Host controller started with --backup option deletes the deployments from the domain/data/content folder after approximately 10 mins. 
The deployment is restored or recreated if the HostController is started. 
Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 6.4.x
How reproducible:
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Setup domaincontroller 
2. Setup hostcontroller 
3. Start domaincontroller 
4. Start hostcontroller with --backup option.
5. deploy an application using cli or admin console
./jboss-cli.sh --connect --controller=x.x.x.x:9999 --command=&amp;apos;deploy /PathToApp/App.war --server-groups=main-server-group&amp;apos;
6. deployments are available under $JBOSS_HOME/domain/data/content
7. Wait for approximately 10 minutes
8. Cached deployments are deleted on hostcontroller (domain/data/content is empty). Following is the logging seen on the console :
++++++++++++++
[Host Controller] 14:20:40,439 INFO  [org.jboss.as.repository] (Host Controller Service Threads - 4) JBAS014903: Content /NotBackedUp/JAR-Folder/EAPs/EAP6/jboss-eap-6.4.3-Patched/domain/data/content/47/1108a27fa1b82e6a92fb56ee25bc76f2625249 is obsolete and will be removed
[Host Controller] 14:20:40,440 INFO  [org.jboss.as.repository] (Host Controller Service Threads - 4) JBAS014901: Content removed from location /NotBackedUp/JAR-Folder/EAPs/EAP6/jboss-eap-6.4.3-Patched/domain/data/content/47/1108a27fa1b82e6a92fb56ee25bc76f2625249/content
++++++++++++++
9. After restarting the Host Controller, the deployment is restored and the cached deployment can now be seen under the Host Controller&amp;apos;s domain/data/content folder.
Actual results: Deployment folder form domain/data/content folder gets deleted after approx 10 mins and are restored if the Host Controller is restarted
Expected results: The cached deplpyments folder should never be removed from the HostController&amp;apos;s domain/data/content folder.  
Additional info: This does not affect the availability of the application since the applications are also availbale with the assigned server&amp;apos;s under their data/content folder.
