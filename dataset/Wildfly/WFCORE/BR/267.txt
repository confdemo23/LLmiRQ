CLI prints output twice if using cli client jar
If you are using the CLI client jar, all output is printed twice.  This is because JBoss logging is not set up and by default CommandContextImpl is printing log messages to standard out.  The output will look something like this:






[standalone@localhost:9999 /] :read-children-types
