Capability resolution complaints on admin-only slave HCs not connected to the master
If you start a slave HC in admin-only with no master to connect to, boot is fine but then any modifications made to the config result in capability resolution ERROR messages in the host-controller.log
Starting a slave HC in admin-only with no master to connect to is meant to work, allowing you to use CLI to manipulate the slave&amp;apos;s host config:






bin/domain.sh --host-config=host-slave.xml --admin-only -Djboss.domain.master.address=127.0.0.1






The boot is fine:






[Host Controller] 11:06:10,639 INFO  [org.jboss.as] (Controller Boot Thread) WFLYSRV0025: WildFly Full 10.0.0.Final-SNAPSHOT (WildFly Core 2.0.5.Final) (Host Controller) started in 1152ms - Started 41 of 42 services (12 services are lazy, passive or on-demand)






However, subsequent changes made via management tools (e.g. CLI) succeed but result in ERROR logging by the HC:






[domain@127.0.0.1:9999 /] /host=localhost/system-property=foo:add(value=bar)




{




    "outcome" =&gt; "success",




    "result" =&gt; undefined,




    "server-groups" =&gt; undefined




}






The HC&amp;apos;s log:






[Host Controller] 11:07:37,744 ERROR [org.jboss.as.controller] (management-handler-thread - 4) WFLYCTL0369: Required capabilities are not available:




[Host Controller]     org.wildfly.domain.server-group.other-server-group in context &amp;apos;server-config&amp;apos;; There are no known registration points which can provide this capability.




[Host Controller]     org.wildfly.domain.server-group.main-server-group in context &amp;apos;server-config&amp;apos;; There are no known registration points which can provide this capability.






The boot works without logging because of the enhancement Stuart added such that capability reference failures won&amp;apos;t fail an admin-only boot, thus letting the user use admin-only to fix the config. But then with subsequent changes, the user gets ERRORs notifying them of the unfixed references.
But in this case, the references will never be available, so long as there is no connection to a master to provide the domain-wide config.
This is a general case that needs to be accounted for in the capability resolution logic.
