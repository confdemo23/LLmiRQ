Premature registration of reconnecting server
ServerInventoryImpl.reconnectServer is registering the ProxyController for the reconnecting server with the DomainModelControllerService. The problem is that ProxyController is not yet in a state where it can forward requests to the server. That won&amp;apos;t happen until the server calls back with a DomainServerProtocol.SERVER_RECONNECT_REQUEST and the ServerToHostProtocolHandler.ServerReconnectRequestHandler handles it. The effect is if a request for the server comes in during this window, it will fail. If that request is part of a domain operation rollout (because during the window the HC regarded the server as &amp;apos;live&amp;apos; and instructed the DC to send rollout ops to it), then the domain rollout will be affected. This happened in the testsuite failure I just saw. Most significant logging is as follows:

The HC completes boot. Then servers main-three and other-two register. The HC sends a prepared response to a request. This is the host rollout request to the slave from the DC with the response being the ops to invoke on the servers. The HC reports sending a "pre-prepare failed response" to two requests. These are the requests the DC has asked it to proxy to the servers.
The result of all this for the client is the following failure of a management op:






Failed operation:

    "operation" =&gt; "add",




    "address" =&gt; [("extension" =&gt; "org.jboss.as.test.hc.extension")]

    }




}






The "WFLYHC0153: Channel closed" failure is what is produced when an attempt is made to invoke on a disconnected proxy controller.
