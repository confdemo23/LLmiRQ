re-enable quote parsing
The fix for WFCORE-1804 was committed here.
It has a side-effect that it disables quote parsing. Now the another fix which does not have the side-effect was committed in aesh. The following line in the previous fix should be removed, when the new aesh version is released (0.66.11 or 12?).

        settings.parsingQuotes(false);
