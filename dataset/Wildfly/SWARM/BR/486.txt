Can&apos;t load project-stages.yml on classpath with Arq
problem
project-stages.yml on classpath(src/main/resources) is not loaded with Arquillian tests. I attached the error log and the reproducer in &amp;apos;Steps to Reproduce&amp;apos; section.
Though -swarm try to load it, apparently can&amp;apos;t see it when Arq tests.

workaround
To load the yml explicitly like below.






container.withStageConfig(Paths.get("/tmp", "external-project-stages.yml").toUri().toURL())
