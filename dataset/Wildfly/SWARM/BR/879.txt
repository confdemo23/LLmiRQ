Maven plugin is missing authentication for Maven mirrors
The Maven plugin for Wildfly Swarm does not evaluate the authentication parameters from the settings.xml if mirrors are defined.
Any attempt results in an exception that looks like:
org.eclipse.aether.resolution.ArtifactResolutionException: Failure to transfer ... : Not authorized , ReasonPhrase:Unauthorized.
