ARQ protocol ignores setup actions
In wildfly we have a number of thread context related things go on that associate the current thread with the deployment unit that the call originates from. For this to work in the context of an ARQ deployment we need to call SetupActions in the server side test piece.
With standalone WildFly, this happens in the jmx protocol, which is not being used by Swarm.
While this functionality is missing, certain JNDI, CDI and possibly other stuff won&amp;apos;t work from a Swarm ARQ deployment.
This code, for example, fails with NNFE although the bean is registered under this name.






        InitialContext context = new InitialContext();




        context.lookup("java:module/MySingletonBean");
