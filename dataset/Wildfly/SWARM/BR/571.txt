Arquillian does not include src/main/resource/modules
I use the mssql JDBC driver which is configured in the src/main/module. When running a test with arquillian ("@RunWith(Arquillian.class)"). The jdbc driver is not found when I provide a datasource config via XML or via Java API. I ended up adding the src/main/module via the swarm.build.modules property.
uberjar is working fine.
