Can&apos;t get Ribbon example running
I was trying to get the Ribbon example running (current GitHub master 4/Mar/2016). It didn&amp;apos;t work for me for a couple of reasons:
According to the docs I first tried to launch the React frontend. It failed because the rules in src/main/resources/WEB-INF/undertow-handlers.conf could not be parsed during deployment. Emptying the file helped me to get it deployed, but I don&amp;apos;t know if the rules are necessary.
Benjamin Browning explained me the parsing problem could be because I am on Windows. 
Then I went on launching the time service. The deployment failed because org.wildfly.swarm:jaxrs:1.0.0.Beta3-SNAPSHOT (referenced in some module.xml) could not be found. I worked around this by setting org.wildfly.swarm:jaxrs:1.0.0.Beta2 explicitly in the project&amp;apos;s pom.xml.
Same issue and work-around with the event service.
Once I had all three projects running, I could see the services registering. In the logs as well as on the website. However, I was not able to invoke the time or event service methods by clicking the "GET..." buttons. This is because the services were registered with URLs localhost:8081 instead of http://localhost:8081. As a consequence the URL resolution failed. The frontend tried to connect to http://localhost:8080/localhost:8081 instead of http://localhost:8081. I could not find a way to work around this.
I would appreciate your help to get the sample running.
