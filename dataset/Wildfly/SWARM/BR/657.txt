can&apos;t run tests using the Arquillian Daemon when another application listens on port 12345
On my laptop, a simple mvn clean install fails on the ArquillianTest with

This is caused by another application already listening on port 12345. In my case, that application is the HipChat client. Sorry, I can&amp;apos;t just stop using it right now , so I need a way to change the Arquillian Daemon&amp;apos;s port. There&amp;apos;s TODO: allow overriding the default port? for that already in DaemonServiceActivator.DaemonService.start.
A simple system property would work just fine IMHO.
