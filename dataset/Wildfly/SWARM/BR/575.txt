swarmtool fails on javaee7 Stateless EJB example
This is related to SWARM-500, which gives instructions on downloading the Java EE 7 samples. SWARM-500 uses maven plugin to create the -swarm.jar and now works correctly (hurray!). However, running swarmtool on the resulting .war file instead of using the plugin continues to fail with the following error:
{{Failed downloading javax/transaction/jta/1.0.1B/jta-1.0.1B.jar from http://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public/. Reason:
org.eclipse.aether.transfer.ArtifactNotFoundException: Could not find artifact javax.transaction:jta:jar:1.0.1B in jboss-public-repository-group (http://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public/), try downloading from http://java.sun.com/products/jta}}
