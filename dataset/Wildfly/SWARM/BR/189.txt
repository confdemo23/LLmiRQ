HTTP endpoint should not be reachable before deployment is finished
In e.g. SpringBoot, when I start my application I either cannot reach the HTTP port at all (port is closed) or it is serving my content.
In WildFly Swarm (Alpha 5) the HTTP endpoint is open during the deployment phase what leads to HTTP 404 errors.
This makes error handling unnecessary complicated for surrounding services.
Swarm should therefore either not open the HTTP port or at least not accept connections until deployment is finished.
