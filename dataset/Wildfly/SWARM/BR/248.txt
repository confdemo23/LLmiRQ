Classpath for wildfly-swarm:run includes jars that should only be present in WEB-INF/lib
When running &amp;apos;mvn wildfly-swarm:run&amp;apos; to execute a Swarm application, every Jar that is a dependency of the project is added to the classpath of the execution.
This has consequences for how META-INF/services files are detected via JBoss Modules, because it makes them visible through the sun.jdk module. The problem is that the class associated with that service entry is unable to be found and causes an exception.
We need to limit the contents of the classpath when running the plugin to only what is necessary, and not jars which should only be present inside the Application
