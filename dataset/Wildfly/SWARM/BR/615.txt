Manual lookup of CDI-Instance doesn&apos;t work since 2016.8.1
Since swarm release 2016.8.1 a manual lookup of the current CDI-instance from within application code results the following error:






Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unable to locate CDIProvider




        at javax.enterprise.inject.spi.CDI.findAllProviders(CDI.java:139)




        at javax.enterprise.inject.spi.CDI.getCDIProvider(CDI.java:120)




        at javax.enterprise.inject.spi.CDI.current(CDI.java:56)






I&amp;apos;ve got a scenario where i have to lookup a CDI-Bean manually and for this i need the CDI-instance. The problem occurs when starting the swarm app from the IDE and via java-jar swarmjar. It&amp;apos;s possible to reproduce by add the following snippet in a simple rest-ressource.






CDI&lt;Object&gt; current = CDI.current();
