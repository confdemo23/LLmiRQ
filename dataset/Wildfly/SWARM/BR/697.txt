StackOverflowError during gradle artifactresolving
When building with gradle an a StackOverflowError occurs when there is a 3rd-party dependency with circular dependencies to other 3rd-party-libs. (Recursion in method "fullTree")
In gradle I have to possibility to force the build to take another version of the 3rd-party lib, which may have fixed the circular error. (https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.artifacts.ResolutionStrategy.html). But this option to quick-fix the error from outside the swarm-buildplugin doesn&amp;apos;t work, because the GradleArtifactResolvingHelper from swarm is using  a detached configuration, where I can&amp;apos;t define this forced-dependencies.
The GradleArtifactResolvingHelper should use gradle-features to resolve the artifacts from a specific configuration instead of implement this with the recursive method &amp;apos;fullTree&amp;apos;. gradle can handle this circular dependencies and is much faster! The ResolvingHelper should also apply the forced-versions from the resolutionstrategy of the configuration &amp;apos;compile&amp;apos; to the detached configuration.
