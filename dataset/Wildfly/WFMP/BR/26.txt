Commands#failOnError defaults to false unless set explicitly
I&amp;apos;ve been working on a PR to support failOnError for script execution, per the discussion on GitHub PR #47.
Leaving aside the fact that the note in the comment on this @Parameter states that "this setting is not used for scripts" and "Scripts must handle errors on their own," and that the impetus for the "not failing on error" was that CLI module handling (add/remove) is broken in both commands and scripts for "if-end-if" and "try-catch"; the setting isn&amp;apos;t behaving as expected.
During debugging, unless the configuration is set explicitly, the default value is always false, even though defaultValue = "true" is set in the annotation.
I don&amp;apos;t know enough about Mojo DI to know if this is an artifact of a @Parameter of a @Parameter or something else, but explicitly setting private boolean failOnError = true; in Commands produces the expected results.
I have a PR with tests of you&amp;apos;re interested, but it means exposing the Commands field via ExecuteCommandsMojo#getCommands() for inspection during testing.
