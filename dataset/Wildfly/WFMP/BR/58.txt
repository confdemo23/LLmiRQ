The WildFly plugin&apos;s shutdown(reload=true) goal doesn&apos;t wait for the server to come back up
If you call the shutdown(reload=true) goal, followed by the deploy-artifact goal, it goes boom. The reload operation runs asynchronously, and temporarily takes down the management interface that the deploy-artifact goal needs to succeed, creating a race condition that has ended badly 100% of the time for me.
Why might a project need to reload then deploy? For instance, it might start the server, use execute-commands to set system properties required by an application, then reload and use deploy-artifact to deploy that application. Similarly, you might want to reconfigure SSL and then reload, as that change also requires it.
It&amp;apos;s worth noting that this likely has a simple fix: just copy the "wait for server to be ready" code used in the start goal over to the shutdown goal&amp;apos;s reload handling.
