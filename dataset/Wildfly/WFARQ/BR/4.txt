Injection of ArquillianResource URL fails in Wildfly 10 CR4
I recently added injection of an ArquillianResource URL to a test.  I also just tried upgrading from WF9 to WF10.CR4.  In CR4, it seems that this injection is working a bit weird.
My injection is very simple






    @ArquillianResource




    private URL url;






However, I see this output when running (note that my HTTP listener is on 8082)






11:37:40,922 INFO  [org.apache.http.impl.client.DefaultHttpClient] (default task-46) I/O exception (java.net.SocketException) caught when connecting to {}-&gt;http://[::]:8082: Network is unreachable

It would appear that the host portion of the URL is being lost.
