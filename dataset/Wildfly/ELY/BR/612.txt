Missing or unnecessary null check in AbstractDigestMechanism
There is missing or unnecessary null check in getSaltedPasswordFromTwoWay method of org.wildfly.security.sasl.digest.AbstractDigestMechanism. char[] passwordChars is assigned on line 650 [1]. 

In case when null can be assigned to passwordChars then there is missing null check before calling userRealmPasswordDigest(messageDigest, username, realm, passwordChars); on line 658 which can result to NPE.
In case when null cannot be assigned to passwordChars then there is unnecessary null check on line 659.
