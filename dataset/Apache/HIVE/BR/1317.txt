CombineHiveInputFormat throws exception when partition name contains special characters to URI
If a partition name contains characters such as &amp;apos;:&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;|&amp;apos; which have special meaning in URI (hdfs uses URI internally for Path), CombineHiveInputFormat throws an exception. URI was created in CombineHiveInputFormat to compare a path belongs to a partition in partitionToPathInfo. We should bypass URI creation by just string comparisons.
