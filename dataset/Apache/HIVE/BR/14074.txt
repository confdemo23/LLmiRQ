RELOAD FUNCTION should update dropped functions
Due to HIVE-2573, functions are stored in a per-session registry and only loaded in from the metastore when hs2 or hive cli is started. Running RELOAD FUNCTION in the current session is a way to force a reload of the functions, so that changes that occurred in other running sessions will be reflected in the current session, without having to restart the current session. However, while functions that are created in other sessions will now appear in the current session, functions that have been dropped are not removed from the current session&amp;apos;s registry. It seems inconsistent that created functions are updated while dropped functions are not.
