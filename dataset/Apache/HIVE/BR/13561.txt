HiveServer2 is leaking ClassLoaders when add jar / temporary functions are used
I can repo this on branch-1.2 and branch-2.0.
It looks to be the same issues as: HIVE-11408
The patch from HIVE-11408 looks to fix the issue as well.
I&amp;apos;ve updated the patch from HIVE-11408 to be aligned with branch-1.2 and master
