HiveServer can not define its port  correctly
HiveServer.java accept one argument stands for the port of  this server,  but I found that can not accept this argument.
By digging into the source code, I found it may caused by these lines of main function.
if (args.length &gt; 1) 
{
        port = Integer.getInteger(args[0]);
      }

I think they should be: 
if (args.length &gt;= 1) 
{
        port = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
      }

The author may have some different intention,  I think.
