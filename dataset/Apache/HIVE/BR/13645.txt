Beeline needs null-guard around hiveVars and hiveConfVars read
Beeline has a bug wherein if a user does a !save ever, then on next load, if beeline.hiveVariables or beeline.hiveconfvariables are empty, i.e. {} or unspecified, then it loads it as null, and then, on next connect, there is no null-check on these variables leading to an NPE.
