Improve error messages for Hive on Spark in case the cluster has no resources available
I think hive.spark.client.server.connect.timeout should be set greater than spark.yarn.am.waitTime. The default value for 
spark.yarn.am.waitTime is 100s, and the default value for hive.spark.client.server.connect.timeout is 90s, which is not good. We can increase it to a larger value such as 120s.
