HIVE-9500 introduced incompatible change to LazySimpleSerDe public interface
In the process of fixing HIVE-9500, an incompatibility was introduced that will break 3rd party code that relies on LazySimpleSerde. In HIVE-9500, the nested class SerDeParamaters was removed and the method LazySimpleSerDe.initSerdeParms was also removed. They were replaced by a standalone class LazySerDeParameters.
Since this has already been released, I don&amp;apos;t think we should revert the change since that would mean breaking compatibility again. Instead, the best approach would be to support both interfaces, if possible.
