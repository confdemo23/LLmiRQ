CREATE VIEW should expand the query text consistently
We should expand the omitted alias in the same way in "select" and in "group by".
Hive "Group By" recognize "group by" expressions by comparing the literal string.



hive&gt; create view zshao_view as select d, count(1) as cnt from zshao_tt group by d;

OK
