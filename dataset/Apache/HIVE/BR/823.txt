Make table alise in MAPJOIN hint case insensitive
If we use table alias in upper case for MAPJOIN hint, it is ignored. It must be specified in lower case.
Example query:
SELECT /*+ MAPJOIN(N) */ parse_url(ADATA.url,&amp;apos;HOST&amp;apos;) AS domain, N.type AS type
FROM nikeusers N join adserves ADATA on (ADATA.user_id = N.uid)
WHERE ADATA.data_date = &amp;apos;20090901&amp;apos;
This query features reducers in its execution. Attached is output of explain extended.
After changing query to:
SELECT /*+ MAPJOIN */ parse_url(adata.url,&amp;apos;HOST&amp;apos;) AS domain, n.type AS type
FROM nikeusers n join adserves adata on (adata.user_id = N.uid)
WHERE adata.data_date = &amp;apos;20090901&amp;apos;
It executes as expected. Attached is output of explain extended.
Thanks to Zheng for helping and catching this.
