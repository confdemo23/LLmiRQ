ignore white space between entries of hive/hbase table mapping
In hive/hbase integration, when creating a hive/hbase table, white space is not ignored in hbase.columns.mapping. 
e.g. "cf:foo, cf:bar" will create two column families "cf" and " cf" in the underlying hbase table, which is certainly not what the user want and make them confused.
