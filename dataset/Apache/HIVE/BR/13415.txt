Decouple Sessions from thrift binary transport
Current behaviour is:

Open a thrift binary transport
create a session
close the transport

Then the session gets closed. Consequently, all the operations running in the session also get killed.
Whereas, if you open an HTTP transport, and close, the enclosing sessions are not closed. 
This seems like a bad design, having transport and sessions tightly coupled. I&amp;apos;d like to fix this. 
The issue that introduced it is HIVE-9601 Relevant discussions at here, here and mentioned links on those comments. 
Another thing that seems like a slightly bad design is this line of code in ThriftBinaryCLIService:

server.setServerEventHandler(serverEventHandler);



Whereas serverEventHandler is defined by the base class, with no users except one sub-class(ThriftBinaryCLIService), violating the separation of concerns.
