Multiple fixes for Druid handler

Druid query type not recognized after Calcite upgrade; introduced by HIVE-13316.
Fix handling of NULL values for GroupBy queries.
Fix handling of dimension/metrics names, as those names in Druid are case sensitive.
Select Druid query to effectively return no rows when the result is empty (previously returning a single row).
When it is split, each of the parts of a Select query might return more results than threshold; set threshold to max integer in query so we do not face this problem.
