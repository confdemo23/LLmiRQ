NULL values produced by left outer join do not behave as NULL
Consider the following setup:



create table tbl (n bigint, t string); 



insert into tbl values (1, &amp;apos;one&amp;apos;); 

insert into tbl values(2, &amp;apos;two&amp;apos;);



select a.n, a.t, isnull(b.n), isnull(b.t) from (select * from tbl where n = 1) a  left outer join  (select * from tbl where 1 = 2) b on a.n = b.n;



1    one    false    true



The query should return true for isnull(b.n).
I&amp;apos;ve tested by inserting a row with null value for the bigint column into tbl, and isnull returns true in that case.
