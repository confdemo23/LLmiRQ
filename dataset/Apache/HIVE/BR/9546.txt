Create table taking substantially longer time when other select queries are run in parallel.
Create table taking substantially longer time when other select queries are run in parallel.
We were able to reproduce the issue using beeline in two sessions.
Beeline Shell 1: 
 a) create table with no other queries running on hive ( took approximately 0.313 seconds)
 b) Insert Data into the table
 c) Run a select count query on the above table
Beeline Shell 2: 
 a) create table while step c) is running in the Beeline Shell 1. (took approximately 60.431 seconds)
