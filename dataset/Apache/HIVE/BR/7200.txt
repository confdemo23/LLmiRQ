Beeline output displays column heading even if --showHeader=false is set
A few minor/cosmetic issues with the beeline CLI.
1) Tool prints the column headers despite setting the --showHeader to false. This property only seems to affect the subsequent header information that gets printed based on the value of property "headerInterval" (default value is 100).
2) When "showHeader" is true &amp; "headerInterval &gt; 0", the header after the first interval gets printed after &lt;headerInterval - 1&gt; rows. The code seems to count the initial header as a row, if you will.
3) The table footer(the line that closes the table) does not get printed if the "showHeader" is false. I think the table should get closed irrespective of whether it prints the header or not.
