RPC server for spark inside HS2 is not getting server address properly
When hive.spark.client.rpc.server.address is configured, this property is not retrieved properly because we are getting the value by String hiveHost = config.get(HiveConf.ConfVars.SPARK_RPC_SERVER_ADDRESS);  which always returns null in getServerAddress() call of RpcConfiguration.java. Rather it should be String hiveHost = config.get(HiveConf.ConfVars.SPARK_RPC_SERVER_ADDRESS.varname);.
