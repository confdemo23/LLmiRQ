Reducers in dynamic partitioning job spend a lot of time running hadoop.conf.Configuration.getOverlay
I tested this on Hive 1.2.1 but looks like it&amp;apos;s still applicable to 2.0.
I ran this query:



create table flights (



)

PARTITIONED BY (Year int)

CLUSTERED BY (Month)

SORTED BY (DayofMonth) into 12 buckets

STORED AS ORC

TBLPROPERTIES("orc.bloom.filter.columns"="*")

;



(Taken from here: https://github.com/t3rmin4t0r/all-airlines-data/blob/master/ddl/orc.sql)
I profiled just the reduce phase and noticed something odd, the attached graph shows where time was spent during the reducer phase.

Problem seems to relate to https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/branch-2.0/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/exec/FileSinkOperator.java#L903
