ROUND(infinity) chokes
Since 1-arg ROUND returns an integer, it&amp;apos;s hard to fix this without either losing data (return NULL) or making a backwards-incompatible change (return DOUBLE instead of BIGINT).
In any case, we should definitely fix 2-arg ROUND to preserve infinity/NaN/etc, since it is already returning double.
