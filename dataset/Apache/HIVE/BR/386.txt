Streaming processes should be able to return successfully without consuming all their input data.
Currently if a streaming process exits without consuming all data in stdin, it causes a java IOException with Broken pipe. It seems like it should be possible to distinguish between broken pipe and the actual return code of the sub-process; so that broken pipe by itself  should be caught and ignored if the sub-process produced a SUCCESS return code.
