Aborted txns cause false positive "Not enough history available..." msgs
this is a followup to HIVE-13369.  Only open txns should prevent use of a base file.  But ValidTxnList does not make a distinction between open and aborted txns.  The presence of aborted txns causes false positives which can happen too often since the flow is 
1. Worker generates a new base file, 
2. then asynchronously Cleaner removes now-compacted aborted txns.  (strictly speaking it&amp;apos;s Initiator that does the actual clean up)
So we may have base_5 and base_10 and txnid 7 aborted.  Then current impl will disallow use of base_10 though there is no need for that.  Worse, if txnid_4 is aborted and hasn&amp;apos;t been purged yet, base_5 will be rejected as well and then an error will be raised since there is no suitable base file left.
