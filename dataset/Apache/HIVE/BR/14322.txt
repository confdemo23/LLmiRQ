Postgres db issues after Datanucleus 4.x upgrade
With the upgrade to  datanucleus 4.x versions in HIVE-6113, hive does not work properly with postgres.
The nullable fields in the database have string "NULL::character varying" instead of real NULL values. This causes various issues.
One example is -



hive&gt; create table t(i int);

OK

Time taken: 1.9 seconds

hive&gt; create view v as select * from t;

OK

Time taken: 0.542 seconds

hive&gt; select * from v;

FAILED: SemanticException Unable to fetch table v. java.net.URISyntaxException: Relative path in absolute URI: NULL::character%20varying
