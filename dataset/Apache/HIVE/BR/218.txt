predicate on partitioning column is ignored in many places
We tried two queries yesterday that bought up several problems:
1. predicate on partitioning column within a join clause was ignored:
FROM (FROM xxx a SELECT a.xx, a.yy, a.ds WHERE a.ds=2009-01-05 UNION ALL FROM yyy SELECT b.xx, b.yy, b.ds WHERE b.ds=2009-01-05 UNION ALL FROM zzz c SELECT c.xx, c.yy, c.ds WHERE c.ds=2009-01-05) d JOIN aaa e ON (d.xx=e.xx AND e.ds=2009-01-05) INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE ...
the plan tried to scan all partitions!
2. predicate on partitioning clause inside insert clause was ignored (we took the previous query and moved the partition filter to the insert statement)
FROM (FROM xxx a SELECT a.xx, a.yy, a.ds WHERE a.ds=2009-01-05 UNION ALL FROM yyy SELECT b.xx, b.yy, b.ds WHERE b.ds=2009-01-05 UNION ALL FROM zzz c SELECT c.xx, c.yy, c.ds WHERE c.ds=2009-01-05) d JOIN aaa e ON (d.xx=e.xx ) INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE ... WHERE e.ds=2009-01-05; 
the plan again tried to scan all partitions
the really bad thing is that we were able to detect this problem only because of metastore inconsistencies - otherwise - we would have merrily scanned all the data. This is really critical to get fixed - because this means that we may actually be scanning tons of unnecessary data in production.
