HiveAggregateJoinTransposeRule places a heavy load on the metadata system
Finding out whether the input is already unique requires a call to areColumnsUnique that currently (until CALCITE-794 is fixed) places a heavy load on the metadata system. This can lead to long CBO planning.
This is a temporary fix that avoid the call to the method till then.
