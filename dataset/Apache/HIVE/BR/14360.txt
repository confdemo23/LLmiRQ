Starting BeeLine after using !save, there is an error logged: "Error setting configuration: conf"
When saving the configuration in BeeLine the conf attribute is persisted, which should not. When loading the configuration this causes an error message to be printed:

Error setting configuration: conf: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No method matching "setconf" was found in org.apache.hive.beeline.BeeLineOpts.
