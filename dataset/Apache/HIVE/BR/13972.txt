Resolve class dependency issue introduced by HIVE-13354
HIVE-13354 moved a helper class StringableMap from ql/txn/compactor/CompactorMR.java to metastore/txn/TxnUtils.java
This introduced a dependency from ql package to metastore package which is not allowed and fails in a real cluster.
Instead of moving it to metastore, it should be moved to common package.
