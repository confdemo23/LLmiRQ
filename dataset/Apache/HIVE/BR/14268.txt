INSERT-OVERWRITE is not generating an INSERT event during hive replication
During Hive replication invoked from falcon, the source cluster did not generate appropriate INSERT events associated with the INSERT OVERWRITE, generating only an ALTER PARTITION event. However, an ALTER PARTITION is a metadata-only event, and thus, only metadata changes were replicated across, modifying the metadata of the destination, while not updating the data.
