LLAP: Synthetic file ids need collision checks
LLAP synthetic file ids do not have any way of checking whether a collision occurs other than a data-error.
Synthetic file-ids have only been used with unit tests so far - but they will be needed to add cache mechanisms to non-HDFS filesystems.
In case of Synthetic file-ids, it is recommended that we track the full-tuple (path, mtime, len) in the cache so that a cache-hit for the synthetic file-id can be compared against the parameters &amp; only accepted if those match.
