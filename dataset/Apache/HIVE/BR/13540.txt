Casts to numeric types don&apos;t seem to work in hplsql
Maybe I&amp;apos;m doing this wrong? But it seems to be broken.
Casts to string types seem to work fine, but not numbers.
This code:



temp_int     = CAST(&amp;apos;1&amp;apos; AS int);

print temp_int

temp_float   = CAST(&amp;apos;1.2&amp;apos; AS float);

print temp_float

temp_double  = CAST(&amp;apos;1.2&amp;apos; AS double);

print temp_double

temp_decimal = CAST(&amp;apos;1.2&amp;apos; AS decimal(10, 4));

print temp_decimal

temp_string = CAST(&amp;apos;1.2&amp;apos; AS string);

print temp_string



Produces this output:



[vagrant@hdp250 hplsql]$ hplsql -f temp2.hplsql

The software I&amp;apos;m using is not anything released but is pretty close to the trunk, 2 weeks old at most.
