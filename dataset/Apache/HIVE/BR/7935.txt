Support dynamic service discovery for HiveServer2
To support Rolling Upgrade / HA, we need a mechanism by which a JDBC client can dynamically resolve an HiveServer2 to connect to.
High Level Design: 
Whether, dynamic service discovery is supported or not, can be configured by setting HIVE_SERVER2_SUPPORT_DYNAMIC_SERVICE_DISCOVERY. ZooKeeper is used to support this.

When an instance of HiveServer2 comes up, it adds itself as a znode to ZooKeeper under a configurable namespace (HIVE_SERVER2_ZOOKEEPER_NAMESPACE).
A JDBC/ODBC client now specifies the ZooKeeper ensemble in its connection string, instead of pointing to a specific HiveServer2 instance. The JDBC driver, uses the ZooKeeper ensemble to pick an instance of HiveServer2 to connect for the entire session.
When an instance is removed from ZooKeeper, the existing client sessions continue till completion. When the last client session completes, the instance shuts down.
All new client connection pick one of the available HiveServer2 uris from ZooKeeper.
