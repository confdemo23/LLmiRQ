Remove AST dump
For very large queries, dumping the AST can lead to OOM errors. Currently there are two places where we dump the AST:

CalcitePlanner if we are running in DEBUG mode (line 300).
ExplainTask if we use extended explain (line 179).

I guess the original reason to add the dump was to check whether the AST conversion from CBO was working properly, but I think we are past that stage now.
We will remove the logic to dump the AST in explain extended. For debug mode in CalcitePlanner, we will lower the level to LOG.TRACE.
