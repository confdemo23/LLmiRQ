RetryingRawStore will perform partial transaction on retry
By the time the RetryingRawStore retries a command the transaction encompassing it has already been rolled back.  This means that it will perform the remainder of the raw store commands outside of a transaction, unless there is another one encapsulating it which is definitely not always the case, and then fail when it tries to commit the transaction as there is none open.
