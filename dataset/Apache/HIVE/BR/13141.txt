Hive on Spark over HBase should accept parameters starting with "zookeeper.znode"
HBase related paramters has been added by HIVE-12708.
Following the same way,parameters starting with "zookeeper.znode" should be add too,which are also HBase related paramters .
Refering to http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2013/10/what-are-hbase-znodes/
I have seen a failure with Hive on Spark over HBase  due to customize zookeeper.znode.parent.
