ExecDriver::addInputPaths should pass the table properties to the record writer
Currently when ExecDriver encounters a non-existent partition, it creates an empty file so that the query will be valid (and return 0 results).  However, when it does this and calls getHiveRecordWriter(), it creates a new instance of Properties, rather than providing the Properties associated with the table.
This causes RecordWriters that pull information from the table through the Properties to fail (such as Haivvreo).  The RecordWriter should be provided the table&amp;apos;s Properties, as it is in all other cases where it&amp;apos;s called.
