Merge failing of join tree in exceptional case
In some very exceptional cases, SemanticAnayzer fails to merge join tree. Example is below.
create table a (val1 int, val2 int)
create table b (val1 int, val2 int)
create table c (val1 int, val2 int)
create table d (val1 int, val2 int)
create table e (val1 int, val2 int)
1. all same(single) join key --&gt; one MR, good
select * from a join b on a.val1=b.val1 join c on a.val1=c.val1 join d on a.val1=d.val1 join e on a.val1=e.val1
2. two join keys --&gt; expected to have two MR, but resulted to three MR
select * from a join b on a.val1=b.val1 join c on a.val1=c.val1 join d on a.val1=d.val1 join e on a.val2=e.val2
3. by changing the join order, we could attain two MR as first-expectation.
select * from a join e on a.val2=e.val2 join c on a.val1=c.val1 join d on a.val1=d.val1 join b on a.val1=b.val1
