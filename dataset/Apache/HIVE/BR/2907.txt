Hive error when dropping a table with large number of partitions
Running into an "Out Of Memory" error when trying to drop a table with 128K partitions.
The methods dropTable in metastore/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/ObjectStore.java 
and dropTable in ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/exec/DDLTask.java encounter out of memory errors 
when dropping tables with lots of partitions because they try to load the metadata for every partition into memory.
