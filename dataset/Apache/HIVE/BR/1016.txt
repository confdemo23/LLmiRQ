Ability to access DistributedCache from UDFs
There have been several requests on the mailing list for
information about how to access the DistributedCache from UDFs, e.g.:
http://www.mail-archive.com/hive-user@hadoop.apache.org/msg01650.html
http://www.mail-archive.com/hive-user@hadoop.apache.org/msg01926.html
While responses to these emails suggested several workarounds, the only correct
way of accessing the distributed cache is via the static methods of Hadoop&amp;apos;s
DistributedCache class, and all of these methods require that the JobConf be passed
in as a parameter. Hence, giving UDFs access to the distributed cache
reduces to giving UDFs access to the JobConf.
I propose the following changes to GenericUDF/UDAF/UDTF:

Add an exec_init(Configuration conf) method that is called during Operator initialization at runtime.
Change the name of the "initialize" method to "compile_init" to make it clear that this method is called at compile-time.
