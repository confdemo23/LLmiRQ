CASE folding can produce wrong expression
This is a case that was not covered in the testsuite. For the following query:



select (CASE WHEN key = value THEN &amp;apos;1&amp;apos; WHEN true THEN &amp;apos;0&amp;apos; ELSE NULL END)

from src



Currently, we end up folding the select expression to &amp;apos;0&amp;apos;, as we fail bail out in the second statement and fail to account that there are two different possible values for the CASE expression (&amp;apos;1&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;0&amp;apos;).
