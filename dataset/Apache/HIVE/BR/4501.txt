HS2 memory leak - FileSystem objects in FileSystem.CACHE
org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem objects are getting accumulated in FileSystem.CACHE, with HS2 in unsecure mode.
As a workaround, it is possible to set fs.hdfs.impl.disable.cache and fs.file.impl.disable.cache to true.
Users should not have to bother with this extra configuration. 
As a workaround disable impersonation by setting hive.server2.enable.doAs to false.
