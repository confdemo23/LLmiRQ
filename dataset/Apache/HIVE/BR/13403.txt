Make Streaming API not create empty buckets
as of HIVE-11983, when a TransactionBatch is opened in StreamingAPI, a full compliment of bucket files (AbstractRecordWriter.createRecordUpdaters()) is created on disk even though some may end up receiving no data.
It would be better to create them on demand and not clog the FS.
Tez can handle missing (empty) buckets and on MR bucket join algorithms will check if all buckets are there and bail out if not.
