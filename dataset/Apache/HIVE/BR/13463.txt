Fix ImportSemanticAnalyzer to allow for different src/dst filesystems
In ImportSemanticAnalyzer, there is an assumption that the src filesystem for import and the final location are on the same filesystem. Therefore the check for emptiness and getExternalTmpLocation will be looking on the wrong filesystem and will cause an error. The output path should be fed into getExternalTmpLocation to get a temporary file on the correct filesystem. The check for emptiness should use the output filesystem.
