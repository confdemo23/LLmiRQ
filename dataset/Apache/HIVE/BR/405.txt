Cleanup operator initialization
We are always passing the same ObjectInspector, so there is no need to pass it again and again in forward.
Also there is a problem that can ONLY be fixed by passing ObjectInspector in init: Outer Joins - Outer Joins may not be able to get ObjectInspectors for all inputs, as a result, there is no way to construct an output ObjectInspector based on the inputs. Currently we have hard-coded code that assumes joins are always outputting Strings, which did break but was hidden by the old framework (because we do toString() when serializing the output, and toString() is defined for all Java Classes).
