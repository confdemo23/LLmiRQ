Column Names trimmed of leading and trailing spaces
PROBLEM:
As per the Hive Language DDL: 
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL
In Hive 0.12 and earlier, only alphanumeric and underscore characters are allowed in table and column names.
In Hive 0.13 and later, column names can contain any Unicode character (see HIVE-6013). Any column name that is specified within backticks (`) is treated literally.
However column names



` left` resulted in `left`

` middle ` resulted in `middle`

`right ` resulted in `right`

`middle space` resulted in `middle space`

` middle space ` resulted in `middle space`
