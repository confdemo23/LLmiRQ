Silent flag does not work on local jobs.
The commands
  hive2 -S -e "from tmp_foo select count(1)" &gt; my_stdout.txt
and
  hive2 -S -hiveconf mapred.job.tracker=local -hiveconf mapred.local.dir=/tmp/foo -e "from tmp_foo select count(1)" &gt; my_stdout.txt
give different results.
The former looks like:
56
and the latter looks like:
plan = /tmp/plan61908.xml
Number of reduce tasks determined at compile time: 1
In order to change the average load for a reducer (in bytes):
  set hive.exec.reducers.bytes.per.reducer=&lt;number&gt;
In order to limit the maximum number of reducers:
  set hive.exec.reducers.max=&lt;number&gt;
In order to set a constant number of reducers:
  set mapred.reduce.tasks=&lt;number&gt;
