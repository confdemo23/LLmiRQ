Alter command execution "when HDFS is down" results in holding stale data in MetaStore 
Lets  consider, the  "DFS" is down , 
And on executing an alter query say  "alter table firsttable rename to secondtable".  
the query execution fails with the following exception:
 
InvalidOperationException(message:Unable to access old location hdfs://localhost:9000/user/hive/warehouse/firsttable for table default.firsttable)
Now after starting the DFS and then executing the same query , the client gets the following exception:

NoSuchObjectException(message:default.firsttable table not found)
Root Cause
In Alter Query execution flow, first "MetaStore" operation is executed successfully and then "DFS" operation is started. In this scenario, "DFS" is down. As a result, execution of the query failed and partial information of the operation is saved.
