"LOAD DATA" does not honor permission inheritence
When a "LOAD DATA" operation is performed the resulting data in hdfs for the table does not maintain permission inheritance. This remains true even with the "hive.warehouse.subdir.inherit.perms" set to true.
The issue is easily reproducible by creating a table and loading some data into it. After the load is complete just do a "dfs -ls -R" on the warehouse directory and you will see that the inheritance of permissions worked for the table directory but not for the data.
