push down predicates with an and-operator between non-SARGable predicates will get NPE
When all of the predicates in an AND-operator in a SARG expression get removed by the SARG builder, evaluation can end up with a NPE. Sub-expressions are typically removed from AND-operators because they aren&amp;apos;t SARGable.
