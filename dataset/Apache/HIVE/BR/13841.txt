Orc split generation returns different strategies with cache enabled vs disabled
Split strategy chosen by OrcInputFormat should not change when enabling or disabling footer cache. Currently if footer cache is disabled minSplits in OrcInputFormat.Context will be set to -1 which is used during determination of split strategies. minSplits should be set to requested value or some default instead of cache size
