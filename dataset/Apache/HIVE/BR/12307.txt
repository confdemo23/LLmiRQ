Streaming API TransactionBatch.close() must abort any remaining transactions in the batch
When the client of TransactionBatch API encounters an error it must close() the batch and start a new one.  This prevents attempts to continue writing to a file that may damaged in some way.
The close() should ensure to abort the any txns that still remain in the batch and close (best effort) all the files it&amp;apos;s writing to.  The batch should also put itself into a mode where any future ops on this batch fail.
