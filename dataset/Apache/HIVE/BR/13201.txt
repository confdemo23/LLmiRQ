Compaction shouldn&apos;t be allowed on non-ACID table
Looks like compaction is allowed on non-ACID table, although that&amp;apos;s of no sense and does nothing. Moreover the compaction request will be enqueued into COMPACTION_QUEUE metastore table, which brings unnecessary overhead.
We should prevent compaction commands being allowed on non-ACID tables.
