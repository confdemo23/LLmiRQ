Column stats give incorrect min and distinct_count
It seems that the result from column statistics isn&amp;apos;t correct on two measures for numeric columns: min (which is always 0) and distinct count. Here is an example:



select count(distinct avgTimeOnSite), min(avgTimeOnSite) from UserVisits_web_text_none;

...

OK

9	1

The statisitics for the column:



desc formatted UserVisits_web_text_none avgTimeOnSite

...
