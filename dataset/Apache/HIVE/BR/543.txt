provide option to run hive in local mode
this is a little bit more than just mapred.job.tracker=local
when run in this mode - multiple jobs are an issue since writing to same tmp directories is an issue. the following options:
hadoop.tmp.dir
mapred.local.dir
need to be randomized (perhaps based on queryid).
