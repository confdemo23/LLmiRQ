Support masking and filtering of rows/columns
Traditionally, access control at the row and column level is implemented through views. Using views as an access control method works well only when access rules, restrictions, and conditions are monolithic and simple. It however becomes ineffective when view definitions become too complex because of the complexity and granularity of privacy and security policies. It also becomes costly when a large number of views must be manually updated and maintained. In addition, the ability to update views proves to be challenging. As privacy and security policies evolve, required updates to views may negatively affect the security logic particularly when database applications reference the views directly by name. HIVE row and column access control helps resolve all these problems.
