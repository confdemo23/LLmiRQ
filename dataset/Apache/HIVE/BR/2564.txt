Set dbname at JDBC URL or properties
The current Hive implementation ignores a database name at JDBC URL, 
though we can set it by executing "use &lt;DBNAME&gt;" statement.
I think it is better to also specify a database name at JDBC URL or database properties.
Therefore, I&amp;apos;ll attach the patch.
