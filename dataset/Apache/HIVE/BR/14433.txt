refactor LLAP plan cache avoidance and fix issue in merge processor
Map and reduce processors do this:

    if (LlapProxy.isDaemon()) {

      cache = new org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.mr.ObjectCache(); // do not cache plan

...



but merge processor just gets the plan. If it runs in LLAP, it can get a cached plan. Need to move this logic into ObjectCache itself, via a isPlan arg or something. That will also fix this issue for merge processor
