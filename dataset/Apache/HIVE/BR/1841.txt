 datanucleus.fixedDatastore should be true in hive-default.xml
Two datanucleus variables:

&lt;property&gt;

 &lt;name&gt;datanucleus.autoCreateSchema&lt;/name&gt;

 &lt;value&gt;false&lt;/value&gt;

&lt;/property&gt;



&lt;property&gt;

 &lt;name&gt;datanucleus.fixedDatastore&lt;/name&gt;

 &lt;value&gt;true&lt;/value&gt;

&lt;/property&gt;



are dangerous.  We do want the schema to auto-create itself, but we do not want the schema to auto update itself. 
Someone might accidentally point a trunk at the wrong meta-store and unknowingly update. I believe we should set this to false and possibly trap exceptions stemming from hive wanting to do any update. This way someone has to actively acknowledge the update, by setting this to true and then starting up hive, or leaving it false, removing schema modifies for the user that hive usages, and doing all the time and doing the updates by hand.
