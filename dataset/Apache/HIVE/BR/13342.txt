Improve logging in llap decider and throw exception in case llap mode is all but we cannot run in llap.
Currently we do not log our decisions with respect to llap. Are we running everything in llap mode or only parts of the plan. We need more logging. Also, if llap mode is all but for some reason, we cannot run the work in llap mode, fail and throw an exception advise the user to change the mode to auto.
