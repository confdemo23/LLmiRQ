Refactor partition pruning code as an optimizer transformation
Some bugs with partition pruning have been reported and the correct fix for many of them is to rewrite the partition pruning code as an optimizer transformation which gets kicked in after the predicate pushdown code. This refactor also uses the graph walker framework so that the partition pruning code gets consolidated well with the frameworks and does not work on the query block but rather works on the operator tree.
