ALTER TABLE ADD PARTITION fails with a remote Thrift metastore
If the hive cli is configured to use a remote metastore, ALTER TABLE ... ADD PARTITION commands will fail with an error similar to the following:
[pradeepk@chargesize:~/dev/howl]hive --auxpath ult-serde.jar -e "ALTER TABLE mytable add partition(datestamp = &amp;apos;20091101&amp;apos;, srcid = &amp;apos;10&amp;apos;,action) location &amp;apos;/user/pradeepk/mytable/20091101/10&amp;apos;;"

This is due to a check that tries to retrieve the partition to see if it exists. If it does not, an attempt is made to pass a null value from the metastore. Since thrift does not support null return values, an exception is thrown.
