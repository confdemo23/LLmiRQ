Redundant setting full file status in Hive::copyFiles
We set full file status in each copy-file thread. I think it&amp;apos;s redundant and hurts performance when we have multiple files to copy.



            if (inheritPerms) {

              ShimLoader.getHadoopShims().setFullFileStatus(conf, fullDestStatus, destFs, destf);

            }
