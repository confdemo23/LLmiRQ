Multiple insert overwrite into multiple tables query stores same results in all tables
(Note: This might be related to HIVE-2750)
I am doing a query with multiple INSERT OVERWRITE to multiple tables in order to scan the dataset only 1 time, and i end up having all these tables with the same content ! It seems the GROUP BY query that returns results is overwriting all the temp tables.
Weird enough, if i had further GROUP BY queries into additional temp tables, grouped by a different field, then all temp tables, even the ones that would have been wrong content are all correctly populated.
This is the misbehaving query:
    FROM nikon
    INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE e1
    SELECT qs_cs_s_aid AS Emplacements, COUNT AS Impressions
    WHERE qs_cs_s_cat=&amp;apos;PRINT&amp;apos; GROUP BY qs_cs_s_aid
    INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE e2
    SELECT qs_cs_s_aid AS Emplacements, COUNT AS Vues
    WHERE qs_cs_s_cat=&amp;apos;VIEW&amp;apos; GROUP BY qs_cs_s_aid
    ;
It launches only one MR job and here are the results. Why does table &amp;apos;e1&amp;apos; contains results from table &amp;apos;e2&amp;apos; ?! Table &amp;apos;e1&amp;apos; should have been empty (see individual SELECTs further below)
    hive&gt; SELECT * from e1;
    OK
    NULL    2
    1627575 25
    1627576 70
    1690950 22
    1690952 42
    1696705 199
    1696706 66
    1696730 229
    1696759 85
    1696893 218

    hive&gt; SELECT * from e2;
    OK
    NULL    2
    1627575 25
    1627576 70
    1690950 22
    1690952 42
    1696705 199
    1696706 66

Here is are the result to the indiviual queries (only the second query returns a result set):
    hive&gt; SELECT qs_cs_s_aid AS Emplacements, COUNT AS Impressions FROM nikon
    WHERE qs_cs_s_cat=&amp;apos;PRINT&amp;apos; GROUP BY qs_cs_s_aid;
    (...)
    OK
          &lt;- There are no results, this is normal

    hive&gt; SELECT qs_cs_s_aid AS Emplacements, COUNT AS Vues FROM nikon
    WHERE qs_cs_s_cat=&amp;apos;VIEW&amp;apos; GROUP BY qs_cs_s_aid;
    (...)
    OK
    NULL  2
    1627575 25
    1627576 70
    1690950 22
