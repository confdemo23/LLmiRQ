downgrade JDO version
After HIVE-1609, we are seeing some table not found errors intermittently.
We have a test case where 5 processes are concurrently issueing the same query - 
explain extended insert .. select from &lt;T&gt;
and once in a while, we get a error &lt;T&gt; not found - 
When we revert back the JDO version, the error is gone.
We can investigate later to find the JDO bug, but for now this is a show-stopper for facebook, and needs
to be reverted back immediately.
This also means, that the filters will not be pushed to mysql.
