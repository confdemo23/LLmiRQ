hive fails to build in eclipse due to syntax error in BitmapIndexHandler.java
I see the following error in helios eclipse with the latest trunk (although build on the command line is fine):
Syntax error on token ";", delete this token
seems to have been introduced by this change in HIVE-2036
+import org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.index.HiveIndexedInputFormat;;
I have a patch forthcoming.
