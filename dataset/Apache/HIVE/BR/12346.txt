Internally used variables in HiveConf should not be settable via command
Some HiveConf variables such as hive.added.jars.path are only for internal use and should not be settable via set command. 
We saw a lot of cases that users mistakenly set these variables using set command despite some of them have been documented as "internal parameter" in Hive. The command usually succeeds but it sometimes does not effect, which causes some confusions. For example, the hive.added.jars.path can be set via set command but it is sometimes overridden by session resource jars during runtime.
