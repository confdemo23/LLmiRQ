windowing function returns incorrect result when the window size is larger than the partition size
In PTF windowing, when the partition is small and the window size is larger than the partition size, we are seeing incorrect result. It happens for max, min, first_value, last_value and sum functions. 

CREATE TABLE sdy1(

ord int,

type string);



The data is:

2 a

3 a

1 a 



The result is as follows for the query select ord, min(ord) over (partition by type order by ord rows between 1 preceding and 7 following)

1 1

2 1

3 1 



The expected result is:

1 1

2 1

3 2
