Union All of different types resolves to incorrect data
create table src(c1 date, c2 int, c3 double);
insert into src values (&amp;apos;2016-01-01&amp;apos;,5,1.25);
select * from 
(select c1 from src union all
select c2 from src union all
select c3 from src) t;
It will return NULL for the c1 values. Seems the common data type is resolved to the last c3 which is double.
