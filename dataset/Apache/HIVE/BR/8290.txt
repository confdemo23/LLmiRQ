With DbTxnManager configured, all ORC tables forced to be transactional
Currently, once a user configures DbTxnManager to the be transaction manager, all tables that use ORC are expected to be transactional.  This means they all have to have buckets.  This most likely won&amp;apos;t be what users want.
We need to add a specific mark to a table so that users can indicate it should be treated in a transactional way.
