Displaying inconsistent CPU usage data with MR execution engine
If the MR task is finished after printing the cumulative CPU time then there is the possibility to print inconsistent CPU usage information.
Correct one:

2016-07-12 11:31:42,961 Stage-3 map = 0%,  reduce = 0%

2016-07-12 11:31:48,237 Stage-3 map = 100%,  reduce = 0%, Cumulative CPU 2.5 sec

MapReduce Total cumulative CPU time: 2 seconds 500 msec

Ended Job = job_1468321038188_0003

MapReduce Jobs Launched: 

Stage-Stage-3: Map: 1   Cumulative CPU: 2.5 sec   HDFS Read: 5864 HDFS Write: 103 SUCCESS

Total MapReduce CPU Time Spent: 2 seconds 500 msec



One type of inconsistent data (easily reproducible one):

2016-07-12 11:39:00,540 Stage-3 map = 0%,  reduce = 0%

Ended Job = job_1468321038188_0004

MapReduce Jobs Launched: 

Stage-Stage-3: Map: 1   Cumulative CPU: 2.51 sec   HDFS Read: 5864 HDFS Write: 103 SUCCESS

Total MapReduce CPU Time Spent: 2 seconds 510 msec
