Failures in Transform don&apos;t stop the job
If the program executed via a SELECT TRANSFORM() USING &amp;apos;foo&amp;apos; exits with a non-zero exit status, Hive proceeds as if nothing bad happened.  The main way that the user knows something bad has happened is if the user checks the logs (probably because he got no output).  This is doubly bad if the program only fails part of the time (say, on certain inputs) since the job will still produce output and thus the problem will likely go undetected.
