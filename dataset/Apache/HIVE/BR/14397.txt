Queries ran after reopening of tez session launches additional sessions
Say we have configured hive.server2.tez.default.queues with 2 queues q1 and q2 with default expiry interval of 5 mins.
After 5 mins of non-usage the sessions corresponding to queues q1 and q2 will be expired. When new set of queries are issue after this expiry, the default sessions backed by q1 and q2 and reopened again. Now when we run more queries the reopened sessions are not used instead new session is opened. 
At this point there will be 4 sessions running (2 abandoned sessions and 2 current sessions).
