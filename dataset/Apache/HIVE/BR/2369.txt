Minor typo in error message in HiveConnection.java (JDBC)
There is a minor typo issue in HiveConnection.java (jdbc) :

throw new SQLException("Could not establish connecton to "

            + uri + ": " + e.getMessage(), "08S01");

It seems like there&amp;apos;s a "i" missing.
I know it&amp;apos;s a very minor typo but I report it anyway. I won&amp;apos;t attach a patch because it would be too long for me to SVN checkout just for 1 letter.
