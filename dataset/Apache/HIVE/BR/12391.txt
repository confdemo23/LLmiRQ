SkewJoinOptimizer might not kick in if columns are renamed after TableScanOperator
SkewJoinOptimizer will not kick in if the columns are just renamed after the TS e.g. by the creation of a derived table.
To reproduce, consider the following example:



set hive.optimize.skewjoin.compiletime = true;



CREATE TABLE T1(key STRING, val STRING)

SKEWED BY (key) ON ((2)) STORED AS TEXTFILE;



CREATE TABLE T2(key STRING, val STRING)

SKEWED BY (key) ON ((3)) STORED AS TEXTFILE;



For this query, SkewJoinOptimizer kicks in:



SELECT a.*, b.*

FROM T1 a JOIN T2 b

ON a.key = b.key



For this one, it does not:



SELECT a.*, b.*

FROM 

  (SELECT key as k, val as v FROM T1) a

  JOIN

  (SELECT key as k, val as v FROM T2) b

ON a.k = b.k;



The reason is that SkewJoinOptimizer does not backtrack the origin of the column. Instead it just uses its name to know if it is produced by a certain TS.
