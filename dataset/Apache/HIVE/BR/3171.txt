Bucketed sort merge join doesn&apos;t work when multiple files exist for small alias
Executing a query with the MAPJOIN hint and the bucketed sort merge join optimizations enabled:

set hive.input.format=org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.BucketizedHiveInputFormat;

set hive.optimize.bucketmapjoin = true;

set hive.optimize.bucketmapjoin.sortedmerge = true;



works fine with partitioned tables if there is only one partition in the table. However, if you add a second partition, Hive attempts to do a regular map-side join which can fail because the tables are too large. Hive ought to be able to still do the bucketed sort merge join with partitions.
