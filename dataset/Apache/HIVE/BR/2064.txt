Make call to SecurityUtil.getServerPrincipal unambiguous
HadoopThriftAuthBridge20S calls SecurityUtil.getServerPrincipal and passes null for the 2nd arg. When building against the hadoop security branch this is a compilation error as it matches the signatures of both getServerPrincipal methods (one takes a String for the 2nd arg, one an InetAddress). This call needs to be made unambiguous eg by passing "0.0.0.0" instead of null, which per the getServerPrincipal javadoc is equivalent:

It replaces hostname pattern with hostname, which should be

fully-qualified domain name. If hostname is null or "0.0.0.0", it uses
dynamically looked-up fqdn of the current host instead.
