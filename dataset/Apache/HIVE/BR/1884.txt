Potential risk of resource leaks in Hive
There are couple of resource leaks.
For example,
In CliDriver.java, Method :- processReader() the buffered reader is not closed.
Also there are risk(s) of  resource(s) getting leaked , in such cases we need to re factor the code to move closing of resources in finally block.
For Example :- 
In Throttle.java   Method:- checkJobTracker() , the following code snippet might cause resource leak.



InputStream in = url.openStream();

in.read(buffer);

in.close();



Ideally and as per the best coding practices it should be like below





InputStream in=null;

try   {

        in = url.openStream();

        int numRead = in.read(buffer);

}

finally {

       IOUtils.closeStream(in);

}





Similar cases, were found in ExplainTask.java, DDLTask.java etc.Need to re factor all such occurrences.
