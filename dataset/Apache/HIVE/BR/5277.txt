HBase handler skips rows with null valued first cells when only row key is selected
HBaseStorageHandler skips rows with null valued first cells when only row key is selected.

SELECT key, col1, col2 FROM hbase_table;

key1	cell1	cell2 

key2	NULL	cell3



SELECT COUNT(key) FROM hbase_table;

1



HiveHBaseTableInputFormat.getRecordReader makes first cell selected to avoid skipping rows. But when the first cell is null, HBase skips that row.
http://hbase.apache.org/book/perf.reading.html 12.9.6. Optimal Loading of Row Keys describes how to deal with this problem.
