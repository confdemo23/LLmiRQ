Incorrect group-by aggregation in 0.11.0

group by with sub queries does not correctly aggregate results in Hive 0.11.0.
To reproduce:
Put the file



1,b

2,c

2,b

3,a

3,c

4,a



in HDFS, and run



create external table abc (x int, y string) row format delimited fields terminated by &amp;apos;,&amp;apos; location &amp;apos;/data/&amp;apos;;



The query



select

        x,

        count(*)

from

(select

        x,

        y

from

        abc

group by

      x,

      y

) a

group by

        x;



will then give the result



2	1

3	1

2	1

4	1

3	1

1	1



instead of the correct



1	1

2	2

3	2

4	1



In 0.9.0 and 0.10.0 this is all working correctly.
