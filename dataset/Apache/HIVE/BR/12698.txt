Remove exposure to internal privilege and principal classes in HiveAuthorizer
The changes in HIVE-11179 expose several internal classes to HiveAuthorization implementations. These include PrivilegeObjectDesc, PrivilegeDesc, PrincipalDesc and AuthorizationUtils.
We should avoid exposing that to all Authorization implementations, but also make the ability to customize the mapping of internal classes to the public api classes possible for Apache Sentry (incubating).
