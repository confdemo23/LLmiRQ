NDC stopped working in LLAP logging
NDC context were missing from the log lines. Reason for it is NDC class is part of log4j-1.2-api (bridge jar). This is added as compile time dependency. Due to the absence of this jar in llap daemons, the NDC context failed to initialize. Log4j2 replaced NDC with ThreadContext. Hence we need the bridge jar.
