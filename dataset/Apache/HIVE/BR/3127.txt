Pass hconf values as XML instead of command line arguments to child JVM
The maximum length of the DOS command string is 8191 characters (in Windows latest versions http://support.microsoft.com/kb/830473). This limit will be exceeded easily when it appends individual hconf values to the command string. To work around this problem, Write all changed hconf values to a temp file and pass the temp file path to the child jvm to read and initialize the -hconf parameters from file.
