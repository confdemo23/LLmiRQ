Memory leak in Hive Metastore
Looking a heap dump of 10GB, a large number of Configuration objects(&gt; 66k instances) are being retained. These objects along with its retained set is occupying about 95% of the heap space. This leads to HMS crashes every few days.
I will attach an exported snapshot from the eclipse MAT.
