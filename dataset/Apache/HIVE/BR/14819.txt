FunctionInfo for permanent functions shows TEMPORARY FunctionType
The FunctionInfo has a FunctionType field which describes if the function is a builtin/persistent/temporary function. But for permanent functions, the FunctionInfo being returned by the FunctionRegistry is showing the type to be TEMPORARY.
This affects things which may be depending on function type, for example LlapDecider, which will allow builtin/persistent UDFs to be used in LLAP but not temporary functions.
