mapjoin_subquery  dump small table (mapjoin table) to the same file
in mapjoin_subquery.q  there is a query
SELECT /*+ MAPJOIN(z) */ subq.key1, z.value
FROM
(SELECT /*+ MAPJOIN */ x.key as key1, x.value as value1, y.key as key2, y.value as value2 
 FROM src1 x JOIN src y ON (x.key = y.key)) subq
 JOIN srcpart z ON (subq.key1 = z.key and z.ds=&amp;apos;2008-04-08&amp;apos; and z.hr=11);
when dump x and z to a local file,there all dump to the same file, so we lost the data of x
