getPartitionDescFromPath() in CombineHiveInputFormat should handle matching by path
The use case is:



dir = hdfs://host:9000/user/warehouse/tableName/abc

pathToPartitionInfo = {/user/warehouse/tableName : myPart}



Then calling 

 

getPartitionDescFromPath(dir, pathToPartitionInfo)



will throw an IOException because /user/warehouse/tableName is not a prefix of hdfs://host:9000/user/warehouse/tableName/abc. Currently, this is not an issue but will come up if CombineFileInputFormat is modified so what the scheme and authority are not stripped out  when generating splits (see MAPREDUCE-1806).
The proposed solution is add a case where matching is done by just the path component of the URI&amp;apos;s.
