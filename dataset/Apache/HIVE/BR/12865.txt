Exchange partition does not show inputs field for post/pre execute hooks
The pre/post execute hook interface has fields that indicate which Hive objects were read / written to as a result of running the query. For the exchange partition operation, the read entity field is empty.
This is an important issue as the hook interface may be configured to perform critical warehouse operations.
