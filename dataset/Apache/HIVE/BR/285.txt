UNION ALL does not allow different types in the same column

explain INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE t
    SELECT s.r, s.c, sum(s.v) FROM
    (
      SELECT a.r AS r, a.c AS c, a.v AS v FROM t1 a
      UNION ALL
      SELECT b.r AS r, b.c AS c, 0 + b.v AS v FROM t2 b
    ) s
    GROUP BY s.r, s.c;


Both a and b have 3 string columns: r, c, and v.
It compiled successfully but failed during runtime.
"Explain" shows that the plan for the 2 union-all operands have different output types that are converged to STRING, but there is no UDFToString inserted for "0 + b.v AS v" and as a result, SerDe was failing because it expects a String but is passed a Double.
