AccessControlException when load data into table
when loading data in non-supergroup user of hadoop,  hadoop will throw a AccessControlException bacuase Hive try to do write operation at  /tmp directory.
This is obviously not allowed.
see line 752 in Hive.java
Path tmppath = new Path("/tmp/"+randGen.nextInt());
      try 
{

          fs.mkdirs(tmppath);

      ...

    }

those lines will cause that exception.
