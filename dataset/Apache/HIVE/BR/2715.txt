Upgrade Thrift dependency to 0.9.0
I work on HCatalog (0.2). Recently, we ran into HCat_server running out of memory every few days, and it boiled down to a bug in thrift, (THRIFT-1468, recently fixed).
HCat-0.2-branch depends on Hive-0.8, which in turn depends on thrift-0.5.0. (The bug also exists on 0.7.0.)
May I please enquire if Hive can&amp;apos;t depend on a more current version of thrift? (Does it break the metastore?) I&amp;apos;m afraid I&amp;apos;m not privy to the reasoning behind Hive&amp;apos;s dependency on a slightly dated thrift-lib.
