"Insert Overwrite Directory" to accept configurable table row format
There is no way for the users to control the file format when they are outputting the result into a directory.
We should allow:

INSERT OVERWRITE DIRECTORY "/user/zshao/result"
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY &amp;apos;9&amp;apos;
SELECT tablea.* from tablea;
