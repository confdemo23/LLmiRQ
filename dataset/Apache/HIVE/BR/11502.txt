Map side aggregation is extremely slow
For the query as following:

create table tbl2 as 

select col1, max(col2) as col2 

from tbl1 group by col1;



If the column for group by has many different values (for example 400000) and it is in type double, the map side aggregation is very slow. I ran the query which took more than 3 hours , after 3 hours, I have to kill the query.
The same query can finish in 7 seconds, if I turn off map side aggregation by:

set hive.map.aggr = false;
