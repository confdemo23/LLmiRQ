Use FileSystem.access() if available to check file access for user
Hive currently implements its own file access checks to determine if a user is allowed to perform an specified action on a file path (in StorageBasedAuthorizationProvider, also FileUtils). This can be prone to errors or inconsistencies with how file access is actually checked in Hadoop.
HDFS-6570 adds a new FileSystem.access() API, so that we can perform the check using the actual HDFS logic rather than having to imitate that behavior in Hive. For versions of Hadoop that have this API available, we should use this API.
