Use TreeMap instead of Property to make explain extended deterministic
In some places in the code, we are using Properties class in "explain extended".
This makes the order of the lines in the "explain extended" undeterministic because Properties are based on Hashtable class.
We should add another function to show the properties in sorted order.
