cannot create temporary udf dynamically, with a ClassNotFoundException 
I found the ClassLoader cannot load my UDF when doing FunctionTask, because the ClassLoader hasnot append its classpaths on-the-fly yet.
The ExecDriver&amp;apos; s addToClassPath(String[] newPaths) method is the only entry for ClassLoader dynamically append its classhpaths (besides hadoop&amp;apos;s GenericOptionsParser).
But that function wasnot called before FunctionTask getting my UDF class by class name. I think this is the reason why I came across that failure.
scenario description:
I set a peroperty in hive-site.xml to configure the classpath of my udf. 
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;hive.aux.jars.path&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;/home/hadoop/hdpsoft/hive-auxs/zhoumin.jar&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
but failed to register it with a ClassNotFoundException when creating udf through the sql command.
CREATE TEMPORARY FUNCTION strlen AS &amp;apos;hadoop.hive.udf.UdfStringLength&amp;apos;
I&amp;apos;ll make a patch soon.
