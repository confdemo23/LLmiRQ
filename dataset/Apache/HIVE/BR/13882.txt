When hive.server2.async.exec.async.compile is turned on, from JDBC we will get "The query did not generate a result set" 
 The following would fail with  "The query did not generate a result set"
    stmt.execute("SET hive.driver.parallel.compilation=true");
    stmt.execute("SET hive.server2.async.exec.async.compile=true");
    ResultSet res =  stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM " + tableName);
    res.next();
