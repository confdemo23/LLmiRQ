Hive should return the latest hbase cell timestamp as the row timestamp value
When hive talks to hbase and maps hbase timestamp field to one hive column,  seems hive returns the first cell timestamp instead of the latest one as the timestamp value. 
Makes sense to return the latest timestamp since adding the latest cell can be  considered an update to the row.
