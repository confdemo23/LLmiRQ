Clean up UGI objects in FileSystem cache for transactions
One issue with FileSystem.CACHE is that it does not clean itself. The key in that cache includes UGI object. When new UGI objects are created and used with the FileSystem api, new entries get added to the cache.
We need to manually clean up those UGI objects once they are no longer in use.
