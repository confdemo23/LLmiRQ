Add mechanism for disabling tests with intermittent failures



[junit] Begin query: dyn_part_empty.q

    [junit] Running org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestNegativeCliDriver

    [junit] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 1, Time elapsed: 0 sec

    [junit] Test org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestNegativeCliDriver FAILED (crashed)



dyn_part_empty.q has been intermittently failing on Hudson. I was able to reproduce locally,
and with different versions of JUnit (3.8.1, 4.5, 4.8.2).
