The queries like SELECT 1+1;, The target table and database will set to _dummy_database _dummy_table, authorization should skip these kinds of databases or tables.
For authz v1. it has skip them.

for (WriteEntity write : outputs) {

        if (write.isDummy() || write.isPathType()) {

          continue;

        }
