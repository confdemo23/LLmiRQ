JDBC driver makes 2 Open Session Calls for every open session
When HTTP is used as the transport mode by the Hive JDBC driver, we noticed that there is an additional open/close session just to validate the connection. 
TCLIService.Iface client = new TCLIService.Client(new TBinaryProtocol(transport));
      TOpenSessionResp openResp = client.OpenSession(new TOpenSessionReq());
      if (openResp != null) 
{

        client.CloseSession(new TCloseSessionReq(openResp.getSessionHandle()));

      }

The open session call is a costly one and should not be used to test transport.
