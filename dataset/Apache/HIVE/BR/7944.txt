current update stats for columns of a partition of a table is not correct
We worked hard towards faster update stats for columns of a partition of a table previously 
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-7736
and
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-7876
Although there is some improvement, it is only correct in the first run. There will be duplicate column stats later. Thanks to Eugene Koifman &amp;apos;s comments
