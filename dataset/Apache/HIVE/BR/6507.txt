OrcFile table property names are specified as strings
In HIVE-5504, we had to do some special casing in HCatalog to add a particular set of orc table properties from table properties to job properties.
In doing so, it&amp;apos;s obvious that that is a bit cumbersome, and ideally, the list of all orc file table properties should really be an enum, rather than individual loosely tied constant strings. If we were to clean this up, we can clean up other code that references this to reference the entire enum, and avoid future errors when new table properties are introduced, but other referencing code is not updated.
