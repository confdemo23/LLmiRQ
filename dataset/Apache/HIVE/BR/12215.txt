Exchange partition does not show outputs field for post/pre execute hooks
The pre/post execute hook interface has fields that indicate which Hive objects were read / written to as a result of running the query. For the exchange partition operation, these fields (ReadEntity and WriteEntity) are empty. 
This is an important issue as the hook interface may be configured to perform critical warehouse operations.
See

ql/src/test/results/clientpositive/exchange_partition3.q.out




PREHOOK: query: -- This will exchange both partitions hr=1 and hr=2

ALTER TABLE exchange_part_test1 EXCHANGE PARTITION (ds=&amp;apos;2013-04-05&amp;apos;) WITH TABLE exchange_part_test2

PREHOOK: type: ALTERTABLE_EXCHANGEPARTITION

POSTHOOK: query: -- This will exchange both partitions hr=1 and hr=2

ALTER TABLE exchange_part_test1 EXCHANGE PARTITION (ds=&amp;apos;2013-04-05&amp;apos;) WITH TABLE exchange_part_test2

POSTHOOK: type: ALTERTABLE_EXCHANGEPARTITION



Seems it should also print output fields.
