Hive Macro overwritten when multiple macros are used in one column
When multiple macros are used in one column, results of the later ones are over written by that of the first.
For example:
Suppose we have created a table called macro_test with single column x in STRING type, and with data as:
"a"
"bb"
"ccc"
We also create three macros:



CREATE TEMPORARY MACRO STRING_LEN(x string) length(x);

CREATE TEMPORARY MACRO STRING_LEN_PLUS_ONE(x string) length(x)+1;

CREATE TEMPORARY MACRO STRING_LEN_PLUS_TWO(x string) length(x)+2;



When we ran the following query, 



SELECT

    CONCAT(STRING_LEN(x), ":", STRING_LEN_PLUS_ONE(x), ":", STRING_LEN_PLUS_TWO(x)) a

FROM macro_test

SORT BY a DESC;



We get result:
3:3:3
2:2:2
1:1:1
instead of expected:
3:4:5
2:3:4
1:2:3
Currently we are using Hive 1.2.1, and have applied both HIVE-11432 and HIVE-12277 patches.
