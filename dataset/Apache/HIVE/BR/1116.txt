bug with alter table rename when table has property EXTERNAL=FALSE
if the location is not an external location - this would be safer.
the problem right now is that it&amp;apos;s tricky to use the drop and rename way of writing new data into a table. consider:
Initialization block:
drop table a_tmp
create table a_tmp like a;
Loading block:
load data &lt;newdata&gt; into a_tmp;
drop table a;
alter table a_tmp rename to a;
this looks safe. but it&amp;apos;s not. if one runs this multiple times - then data is lost (since &amp;apos;a&amp;apos; is pointing to &amp;apos;a_tmp&amp;apos;&amp;apos;s location after any iteration. and dropping table &amp;apos;a&amp;apos; blows away loaded data in the next iteration). 
if the location is being managed by Hive - then &amp;apos;rename&amp;apos; should switch location as well.
