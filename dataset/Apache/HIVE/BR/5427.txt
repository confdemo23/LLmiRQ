TestMetastoreVersion.testVersionRestriction fails on hive 0.12
TestMetastoreVersion.testVersionRestriction failed on hive 0.12 . See https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-branch-0.12-hadoop1/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore/TestMetastoreVersion/testVersionRestriction/
It also failed in a test run on another machine I ran tests on.
The error - 
FAILED: Execution Error, return code 1 from org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.DDLTask. MetaException(message:Hive Schema version 0.12.0 does not match metastore&amp;apos;s schema version fooVersion Metastore is not upgraded or corrupt)
It looks like the fooVersion set by one test is getting used by this failing test.
