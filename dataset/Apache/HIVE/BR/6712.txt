HS2 JDBC driver is inconsistent w.r.t. auto commit
I see an inconsistency in HS2 JDBC driver code:



  @Override

  public void setAutoCommit(boolean autoCommit) throws SQLException {

    if (autoCommit) {

      throw new SQLException("enabling autocommit is not supported");

    }

  }



From above, it seems that auto commit is not supported. However, 



  @Override

  public boolean getAutoCommit() throws SQLException {

    return true;

  }
