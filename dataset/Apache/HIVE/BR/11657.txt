HIVE-2573 introduces some issues during metastore init (and CLI init)
HIVE-2573 introduced static reload functions call.
It has a few problems:
1) When metastore client is initialized using an externally supplied config (i.e. Hive.get(HiveConf)), it still gets called during static init using the main service config. In my case, even though I have uris in the supplied config to connect to remote MS (which eventually happens), the static call creates objectstore, which is undesirable.
2) It breaks compat - old metastores do not support this call so new clients will fail, and there&amp;apos;s no workaround like not using a new feature because the static call is always made
