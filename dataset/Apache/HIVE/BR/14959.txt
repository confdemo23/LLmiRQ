Fix DISTINCT with windowing when CBO is enabled/disabled
For instance, the following query with CBO off:



select distinct last_value(i) over ( partition by si order by i ),

  first_value(t)  over ( partition by si order by i )

from over10k limit 50;



will fail, with the following message:

SELECT DISTINCT not allowed in the presence of windowing functions when CBO is off
