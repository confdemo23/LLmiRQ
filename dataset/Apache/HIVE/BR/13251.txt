hive can&apos;t read the decimal in AVRO file generated from previous version
HIVE-7174 makes the avro schema change to match avro definition, while it breaks the compatibility if the file is generated from the previous Hive although the file schema from the file for such decimal is not correct based on avro definition. We should allow to read old file format "precision" : "4", "scale": "8", but when we write, we should write in the new format.
