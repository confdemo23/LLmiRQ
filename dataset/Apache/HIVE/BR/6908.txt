TestThriftBinaryCLIService.testExecuteStatementAsync has intermittent failures
This has failed sometimes in the pre-commit tests.
ThriftCLIServiceTest.testExecuteStatementAsync runs two statements.  They are given 100 second timeout total, not sure if its by intention.  As the first is a select query, it will take a majority of the time.  The second statement (create table) should be quicker, but it fails sometimes because timeout is already mostly used up.
The timeout should probably be reset after the first statement.  If the operation finishes before the timeout, it wont have any effect as it&amp;apos;ll break out.
