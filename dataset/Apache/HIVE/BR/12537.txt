RLEv2 doesn&apos;t seem to work
Perhaps I&amp;apos;m doing something wrong or is actually working as expected.
Putting 1 million constant int32 values produces an ORC file of 1MB. Surprisingly, 1 million consecutive ints produces a much smaller file.
Code and FileDump attached.



ObjectInspector inspector = ObjectInspectorFactory.getReflectionObjectInspector(

		Integer.class, ObjectInspectorFactory.ObjectInspectorOptions.JAVA);

Writer w = OrcFile.createWriter(new Path("/tmp/my.orc"), 

			OrcFile.writerOptions(new Configuration())

				.compress(CompressionKind.NONE)

				.inspector(inspector)

				.encodingStrategy(OrcFile.EncodingStrategy.COMPRESSION)

				.version(OrcFile.Version.V_0_12)

		);



for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; ++i) {

	w.addRow(123);

}

w.close();
