bugs with temp directories, trailing blank fields in HBase bulk load
HIVE-1295 had two bugs discovered during testing with production data:
(1) extra directories may be present in the output directory depending on how the cluster is configured; we need to walk down these to find the column family directory
(2) if a record ends with fields which are blank strings, the text format omits the corresponding Control-A delimiters, so we need to fill in blanks for these fields (instead of throwing ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException)
