In Task class and its subclasses logger is initialized in constructor
In Task class and its subclasses logger is initialized in constructor. Log object no need to initialize every time in the constructor, Log object can make it as static object.

Ex:

  public ExecDriver() {

    super();

    LOG = LogFactory.getLog(this.getClass().getName());

    console = new LogHelper(LOG);

    this.jobExecHelper = new HadoopJobExecHelper(job, console, this, this);

  }



Need to change like this

private static final Log LOG = LogFactory.getLog(ExecDriver.class);
