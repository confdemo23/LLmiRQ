Fix Assertion in ExecDriver.execute when assertions are enabled in HADOOP_OPTS
I noticed that when running hive CLI, assertions are not enabled, which was causing me some confusion when debugging an issue.
So, I added the following to my environment:
export HADOOP_OPTS="-ea -esa"
This worked, and allowed me to see assertion failures when executing via CLI.
But then I tried to run a test, and got an assertion failure from the following code in ExecDriver.execute:
    // Turn on speculative execution for reducers
    HiveConf.setVar(job, HiveConf.ConfVars.HADOOPSPECULATIVEEXECREDUCERS,
        HiveConf.getVar(job, HiveConf.ConfVars.HIVESPECULATIVEEXECREDUCERS));
The assertion says it should be using getBoolVar/setBoolVar instead.
