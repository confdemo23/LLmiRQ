Hive macro results on macro_duplicate.q different after adding ORDER BY
Added an order-by to the query in macro_duplicate.q:

-select math_square(a), math_square(b),factorial(a), factorial(b), math_add(a), math_add(b),int(c) from macro_testing;

\ No newline at end of file

+select math_square(a), math_square(b),factorial(a), factorial(b), math_add(a), math_add(b),int(c) from macro_testing order by int(c);



And the results from math_add() changed unexpectedly:

-1      4       1       2       2       4       3

-16     25      24      120     8       10      6

+1      4       1       2       1       4       3

+16     25      24      120     16      25      6
