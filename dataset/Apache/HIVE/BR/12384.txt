Union Operator may produce incorrect result on TEZ
Union queries may produce incorrect result on TEZ.
TEZ removes union op, thus might loose the implicit cast in union op.
Reproduction test case:
set hive.cbo.enable=false;
set hive.execution.engine=tez;
select (x/sum over())  as y from(select cast(1 as decimal(10,0))  as x from (select * from src limit 2)s1 union all select cast(1 as decimal(10,0)) x from (select * from src limit 2) s2 union all select &amp;apos;100000000&amp;apos; x from (select * from src limit 2) s3)u order by y;
select (x/sum over()) as y from(select cast(1 as decimal(10,0))  as x from (select * from src limit 2)s1 union all select cast(1 as decimal(10,0)) x from (select * from src limit 2) s2 union all select cast (null as string) x from (select * from src limit 2) s3)u order by y;
