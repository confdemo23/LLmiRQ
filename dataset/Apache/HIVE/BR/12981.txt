ThriftCLIService uses incompatible getShortName() implementation
ThriftCLIService has a local implementation getShortName() that assumes a short name is always the part before "@" and "/". This is not always the case as Kerberos Rules (from Hadoop&amp;apos;s KerberosName) might actually transform a name to something else.
Considering a pending change to getShortName() (#HADOOP-12751) and the normal use of KerberosName in other parts of Hive it only seems logical to use the standard implementation.
