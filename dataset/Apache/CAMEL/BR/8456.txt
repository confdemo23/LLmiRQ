Remove addCompanyUpdateComment endpoint from camel-linkedin
Underlying resource 



/companies/{company-id}/updates/key={update-key}/update-comments 



does not exist. It was probably added by mistake instead of 



https://api.linkedin.com/v1/people/~/network/updates/key={update-key}/update-comments



 mentioned in the documentation https://developer-programs.linkedin.com/documents/commenting-and-liking-company-share. The resource is already mapped to linkedin://people/addUpdateComment so there is no need to add it to companies prefixed endpoints.
