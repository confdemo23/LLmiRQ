encoding problems in jsonpath
I detected three different encoding problems in jsonpath:

if jsonpath is called with an input stream which has an encoding different from the default encoding (given by Charset.defaultCharset()) then jsonpath still uses the default encoding. Error location in JsonPathEngine:
        else if (json instanceof InputStream) 
{

            InputStream is = (InputStream) json;

            return path.read(is, Charset.defaultCharset().displayName(), 

configuration);}


if jsonpath is called with a json file whose encoding is different from UTF-8, then jsonpath still parses the document with UTF-8. Error location in JsonPathEngine:
       else if (json instanceof File) 
{

            File file = (File) json;

            return path.read(file, configuration);

       }
 path.read(file, configuration) uses always UTF-8


if jsonpath is called with an URL pointing to a JSON document whose encoding is different from UTF-8, then jsonPath still parses the document with UTF-8. Error location in JsonPathEngine:
         else if (json instanceof URL) 
{

            URL url = (URL) json;

            return path.read(url, configuration);

         }
path.read(url, configuration) uses UTF-8

My solution proposal is to determine the encoding of the JSON documents automatically according to the specification RFC-4627 (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt; see chapter 3. Encoding) and then call the method path.read(jsonDocument,foundEncoding,configuration) with the found encoding. See attached patch.
Actually I can commit the patch myself. However, I would like that somebody who is more familiar with jsonpath than I does review my patch.
So please tell me if my patch can be accepted or not. I can then do the actual commit or I will discard the patch.
