some samples&apos; poms are using apache-activemq module which will introduce some lower version of Spring and wstx-asl to the eclipse workspace
When using mvn eclipse:eclipse to setup the workspace for camel example to run. 
I found some camel-cxf related example can&amp;apos;t work in eclipse which is caused by using the lower version of wstx-asl.
We can using the activemq-core instead of apache-activemq to fix this issue.
