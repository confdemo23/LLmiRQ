Create a separate component for camel transport for cxf
The camel-cxf component curently contains too many unrelated functions. It contains:

camel transport for cxf
cxf component
cxfbean component
cxfrs componet
converters

So this causes the code of the component to depend on each other and suck in much too many dependencies. Besides this there are some package dependency cycles in the code which could easily be solved.
A first step is to separate the camel transport for cxf from the rest of the code. It is independent of all other code and can be pulled into a new component. 
Some advantages are: 

The camel transport for cxf needs very few dependencies so it is a vey light weight aproach to combine cxf and camel
The new component nicely shows how to bridge between cxd and camel without the overhead of the other components
We can let the camel-cxf component depdend on the camel transport for cxf so for people using maven no changes are needed

I will attach a patch where I simply deleted anything that is not relevant for camel transport for cxf from the camel-cxf project. This is of course not yet the solution but it shows how small the new component will be and is a good start for doing the split.
I would be very interested about opinions from other developers about the split.
