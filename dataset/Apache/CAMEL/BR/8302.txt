Rabbitmq shouldn&apos;t require/bind queue if not specified 
Current implementation is declaring both exchange and queue on any init (producer or consumer). In case of producer one don&amp;apos;t need queue and may not know who going to be client. 
We can add flag skipQueueDeclare  so that it won&amp;apos;t genrate uuid queue. 
i can provide PR if it helps.
