Log Component documentation for "showAll" option is misleading
Log Component documentation for "showAll" option is misleading or the option does not work as expected.
"showAll 	 false 	 Quick option for turning all options on."
There appear to be several options that are not turned as expected such as "multiline" and "showStackTrace", etc..
