Ambiguous URI in Rest API
Configuration of multiple URIs for the same method in a REST service containing wildcards and fixed parts does not work. Example: 



&lt;get uri="/{uuid}/meta" ...&gt;

&lt;get uri="/{uuid}/{channel}" ...&gt;



This causes ServletRestServletResolveConsumerStrategy.java to identify 2 
consumerPath candidates (lines 70-77), which isn&amp;apos;t handled afterwords (line 80). It probably should use the most specific one in this case.
