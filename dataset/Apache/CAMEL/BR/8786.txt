The ServletContext init parameters check is not right in CamelServletContextListener
CamelServletContextListener always complains, even the parameter is quite useful. 



There are 1 ServletContext init parameters, unknown to Camel. Maybe they are  used by other frameworks? [{routeBuilder-routes=com.mycompany.MyRoute}]



There is the mail thread  about it
