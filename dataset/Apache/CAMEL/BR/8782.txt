Configuring endpoints using reference lookup may fail with matching primitive types with their Object counterpart types

Yeah I had a look its due primtive vs object types, that causes Camel to not match the setter method.
eg the method uses a boolean type, but the returned value from the reference lookup is a java.lang.Boolen type. And therefor its not used. I will log a ticket and fix that.
