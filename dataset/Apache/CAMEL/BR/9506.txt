STOMP component does not handle stream objects
The STOMP component only performs a very simple toString() on the body of the incoming exchange when it creates a STOMP message. This does not work when the body does not support a toString() which gives some reasonable human readable representation of the object. This is exactly the case if you try to do the following:



from("direct:a").marshal().json(JsonLibrary.Gson).to("stomp:topic:foobar")



The result of the JSON serialization is a Stream, and the toString() on a Stream results in an object hash (e.g. "[B@30479402"). A more appropriate thing to do here is similar to what the File component does. (Basically, read the stream for the data.)
