Generic methods used as endpoints fail in Java 8
In Java 8 annotations are duplicated to generics&amp;apos; bridge methods.  Camel, rightly, does not support bridge methods as endpoints.  However, because of this change in the language annotations such as @Consume will end up on them after compilation leaving Camel in an invalid state.
I will attach a sample project.
