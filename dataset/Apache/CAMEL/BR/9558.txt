DefaultErrorHandler logs despite "handled true"
The assumption is that handled exceptions will not be propagated any further.
In version 2.15.5 the test code (from the camel-jetty page) runs fine - but since 2.16.0 the handled exception is propagated to the DefaultErrorHandler which causes ERROR logs for every handled exception.
I could not find a hint in the release notes - so I think it&amp;apos;s a bug.



public class MyTest extends CamelTestSupport {



    @Test

    public void test() throws Exception {

        // using httpclient 4.3.5

        CloseableHttpClient httpclient = HttpClients.createDefault();

        HttpGet httRequest = new HttpGet("http://127.0.0.1:7890/myserver");

        HttpResponse response = httpclient.execute(httRequest);

        assertThat(response.getStatusLine().getStatusCode(), is(500));

    }



    @Override

    protected RouteBuilder createRouteBuilder() throws Exception {

        return new RouteBuilder() {



            @Override

            public void configure() throws Exception {

                from("jetty://http://localhost:7890/myserver").tracing()

                        // use onException to catch all exceptions and return a custom reply message

                        .onException(Exception.class).handled(true)

                        // create a custom failure response

                        .transform(constant("Dude something went wrong"))

                        // we must remember to set error code 500 as handled(true)

                        // otherwise would let Camel thing its a OK response (200)

                        .setHeader(Exchange.HTTP_RESPONSE_CODE, constant(500)).end()

                        // now just force an exception immediately

                        .throwException(new IllegalArgumentException("I cannot do this"));

            }

        };

    }

}
