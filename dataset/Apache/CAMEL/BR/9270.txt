rest-dsl - CORS support doesn&apos;t work with Restlet 2.3
camel-restlet has upgraded to Restlet 2.3 (nice!), but this broke rest-dsl CORS support, because Restlet 2.3 no longer supports setting CORS headers via attributes. There are now API methods for these headers and attributes are ignored with a warning.
Example of the new API method:
