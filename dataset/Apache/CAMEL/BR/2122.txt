XPath injection cannot handle expressions returning strings
trying to inject following:
public void insert(@XPath("concat(&amp;apos;48&amp;apos;,&amp;apos;//node/msisdn/text())") String msisdn) { }
results in  
Can not convert #STRING to a NodeList! exception.
The reason is that XPathAnnotationExpressionFactory uses 
XPathBuilder.xpath(xpath); 
and by default xpath is evaluated as nodeSet.
I think it would be nice to be able to define result type in annotation e.g.
@XPath(value = "concat(&amp;apos;48&amp;apos;,&amp;apos;//node/msisdn/text())", resultType = String.class)
The default would be NodeSet to be backward compatible
