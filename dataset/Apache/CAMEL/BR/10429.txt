CXFRS client requires Exchange.HTTP_URI instead of HTTP_PATH for Camel tranport
The camel-cxfrs doc writes that HTTP_PATH is required for camel-cxfrs producer when it&amp;apos;s used with httpClientAPI option.

The CXF JAXRS front end also provides a http centric client API. You can also invoke this API from camel-cxfrs producer. You need to specify the HTTP_PATH and the HTTP_METHOD and let the producer use the http centric client API by using the URI option httpClientAPI or by setting the message header CxfConstants.CAMEL_CXF_RS_USING_HTTP_API.
However, when Camel transport is used between CXFRS producer and consumer, the invocation succeeds only if it sets HTTP_URI, not HTTP_PATH, to the header.



                from("direct:input.camel")

                    .setHeader(Exchange.HTTP_METHOD, constant("GET"))

                    .setHeader(Exchange.CONTENT_TYPE, constant("text/plain"))

                    .setHeader(Exchange.HTTP_URI, simple("/greeting/hello/${body}"))

                    //.setHeader(Exchange.HTTP_PATH, simple("/greeting/hello/${body}")) // &lt;- fails

                    .inOut("cxfrs:bean:rsClient");



Otherwise it fails with 404 error.
