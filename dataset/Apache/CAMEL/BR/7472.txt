camel-netty - SingleUDPNettyServerBootstrapFactory should wait synchronously for the outcome of joining a UDP multicast group so that we know if the attempt was successful or not
In terms of Netty we need to wait until joining the multicast group is done so that starting the NettyConsumer succeeds or fails accordingly. Then we know exactly if and what failed while trying to join the multicast group.
