Deadletter Failure processor is invoked even if error handling strategy defines to continue routing
When a DeadLetterChannel is used as context scoped error handling strategy with FailureProcessor set and a route scoped error handling strategy is defined to continue routing in case of certain exception classes, then it is observed that even in case of exceptions which belong to exceptions defined in OnException clause, the dead letter&amp;apos;s failure processor is still triggered. 
A test case to simulate this behaviour is pasted.
