Safe copy of DefaultExchange does not propagate &apos;fault&apos; property 
fault property should be copied in the following places:
https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/camel-core/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/impl/DefaultExchange.java#L100
https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/camel-core/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/impl/DefaultExchange.java#L107
Consequences:
DefaultExchange#isFault() does not work if exception property is not set.
