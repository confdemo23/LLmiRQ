Camel Subscribing to messages published by non-camel producers
I have come across an issue with Camel 2.13 when subscribing to a qpid messages published by a non-camel producers. The error happens with both Qpid C++ producer and also a python producer. 
An Null pointer exception is thrown in the JmsBinding.extractHeadersFromJMS on line 173. 
map.put("JMSXUserID", jmsMessage.getStringProperty("JMSXUserID")); 
JMSXUserID has not been set by the publisher as it is a non-JMS publisher. 
java.lang.NullPointerException

Full stack trace not show as it is on a different system
I can see a change was made to JmsBinding.java in Camel 2.12.2 to fix a ActiveMQ issue. This is what has caused the issue. The system is being upgraded from Camel 2.9.2 to Camel 2.13.1 and this issue has been experienced.
