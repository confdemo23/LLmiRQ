Remote Print URI changed to UNC Name
I&amp;apos;m using a printing URI in the form of lpr://lh.abc.de:631/bbk-test (Hostname changed) and getting an PrintException:
Reason: javax.print.PrintException: No printer found with name: \\lhgoe.gbv.de\bbk-test. Please verify that the host and printer are registered and reachable from this machine.
Which is true, since Camel Printer has changed my URI to a Windows UNC (see backslashes).
