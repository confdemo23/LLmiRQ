Converting from stream/reader to string changes line breaks other than "\n"
The IOConverter#toString(Reader/Stream) copies the input data line by line. A line is considered to be terminated by any one of a line feed (&amp;apos;\n&amp;apos;), a carriage return (&amp;apos;\r&amp;apos;), or a carriage return followed immediately by a linefeed. Unfortunately, the lines are always concatenated with "\n", so that HL7 messages (which use "\r") become unusable after conversion.
