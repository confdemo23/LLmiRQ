CamelBlueprintTestSupport - can&apos;t initialize ConfigAdmin configurations
The bugfix CAMEL-8948 seems to make older timing problems related to property-placeholders visible.
To reproduce the problem i changed the test 
org.apache.camel.test.blueprint.ConfigAdminNoReloadLoadConfigurationFileTest 
from the component camel-test-blueprint a bit, respectively the context 
"org/apache/camel/test/blueprint/configadmin-no-reload-loadfile.xml": 
I added the trace Attribute to the camelContext:



&lt;camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint" trace="{{tracing}}"&gt; 



and added also the property to the etc/stuff.cfg 



tracing=true 



Until 2.15.2 this worked fine. From 2.15.3 on the property cannot be 
replaced any more.
But, if setting a breakpoint in CamelBlueprintTestSupport#createBundleContext at loadConfigAdminConfigurationFile() (Line 123 in 2.15.4) - the error occurs even in older versions like 2.14 - so the timing problem seems to be there for a while but did not occur because the loading of the configAdminFile seems to be faster than the event handling during service registration triggered by the code some lines above.
The issue can also be reproduced when replacing a property&amp;apos;s String type 
with int in the MyCoolBean class and setting its value by using the 
placeholder like before but with an int value of course. The test run shows 
that the placeholder "${..}" will not be replaced and leads to a 
NumberfFormatException. 
The production code that is under test works fine in karaf.
