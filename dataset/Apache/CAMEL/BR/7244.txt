PGPDataFormat: verification with subkey restricted by User ID does not work
If you verify a PGP signature with a subkey which should have a certain User ID, then you run into an error.
Reason: The implementation has not taken into account that the subkey has no User ID on its own. One must consider the User ID of its master/primary key.
