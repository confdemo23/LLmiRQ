chmod does not work for the File producer whitout setting a charset
Hello
https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/camel-2.15.2/camel-core/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/component/file/FileOperations.java
Permissions are never updated without setting a charset.
The block code at line 280 seems to be at the wrong place.
Best,
Nicolas.
