camel-mqtt: MQTT wildcard (&apos;+&apos;) subscription broken
MQTT single-level wildcards ("+" character) are broken within topic subscriptions.  This is due to URL encoding/decoding that is done on the component URI, which results in the "+" being replaced with a space.  I also tried with "%2B" instead of the "+" sign, which gave the same result.  
A search led me to CAMEL-8056, which mentions needing to override the useRawUri method to return true.  I&amp;apos;m working on a patch and updated unit tests for this.
