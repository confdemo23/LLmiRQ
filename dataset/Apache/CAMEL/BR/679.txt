Instrumentation agent should be able to register multiple instances of a processor
If you have a route like this: from("jms:queue").to("bean:testBean").to("bean:testBean"),
the second instance of the processor "to(bean:testBean)" will fail to register with mbean server because of duplicated objectname.  As a result, only one instance of the "to(bean:testBean)" processor is visible to mbean server and we won&amp;apos;t set the performance counter of the second instance.
