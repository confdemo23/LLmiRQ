dropped support for multiple blueprint descriptors in unit tests
Looks like update CAMEL-8948 dropped support for multiple blueprint descriptors within CamelBlueprintTestSupport file within camel-test-blueprint component. The symptom is a &amp;apos;java.lang.RuntimeException: InputStream cannot be null&amp;apos; for unit tests that have a getBlueprintDescriptor with multiple file references, i.e. a &amp;apos;+&amp;apos; concatenating two or more descriptor files.
