SftpConsumer : GenericFileRenameProcessStrategy - String index out of bounds
While trying to consume a file via SFTP and using the moveExpression to move the file into a done folder a renameException is thrown.
In GenericFile the relativeFileName reads something like the following.   /incoming/test/file1.txt
When it tries to call this code and exception is thrown because File.separator is &amp;apos;\&amp;apos; in a windows environment.
String relative = relativeFileName.substring(0, relativeFileName.lastIndexOf(File.separator));
