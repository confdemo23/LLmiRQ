DefaultUnitOfWork&apos;s headers for the original message are the same object as the in message headers
For jms messages, the useOriginalMessage does not work when headers are changed during the route because the DefaultUnitOfWork&amp;apos;s headers are the same object as the in message&amp;apos;s headers.
In DefaultUnitOfWork, this.originalInMessage.setHeaders(exchange.getIn().getHeaders()); should be changed to create a copy of the headers instead of directly assigning.
Maybe changed to this.originalInMessage.setHeaders((Map&lt;String,Object&gt;) new CaseInsensitiveMap(exchange.getIn().getHeaders()));
