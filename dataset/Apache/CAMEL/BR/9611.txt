Restlet GET request should not trying to stringify the exchange body
When sending a restlet GET request, the body should not be looked at at all.  
Currently In my exchange i have a java object in the body, and i send a restlet GET request, i expect the restlet response to replace whatever is in the body.  But i get a type conversion error because it is trying to stringify the java object before sending the get request.
I think the body should only be used in PUT and POST request.
Here is the fix in org.apache.camel.component.restlet.DefaultRestletBinding.java  line 151:
   public void populateRestletRequestFromExchange(Request request, Exchange exchange) {
        request.setReferrerRef("camel-restlet");
        String body = null;
        if(request.getMethod() == Method.POST || request.getMethod() == Method.PUT)
        {

        	body = exchange.getIn().getBody(String.class);

    	}
        Form form = new Form();
        // add the body as the key in the form with null value
        form.add(body, null);
