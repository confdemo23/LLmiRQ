Unable to find dynamically loaded languages when using OSGi
The camel-osgi component only supports loading Components via the OSGi bundles in the 1.5.0 release code. It looks like someone started to add more things that can be automatically loaded on the trunk, because there was a refactor to allow TypeConverters to be added via OSGi bundles. 
Definitely, adding Languages is still missing (both in 1.5.0 and on the trunk). Perhaps there are more as well, as I&amp;apos;m not up on all the things that Camel loads using the same mechanism.
I&amp;apos;ve got Languages working by patching my copy of 1.5.0 (basically by creating my own version of the LanguageResolver based on the OSGiComponentResolver), but as the refactor seems to be taking the code in a different direction, I&amp;apos;m not going to push a patch yet.
