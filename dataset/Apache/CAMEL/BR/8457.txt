Correct return types of some endpoints in camel-linkedin
These endpoints return wrong type:

companies/getCompanyUpdateComments - Comments/UpdateComments
companies/getUpdateComments - Comments/UpdateComments
people/getGroupMembershipSettings - GroupMemberships/GroupMembership

so it results in java.lang.ClassCastException.
