Docs for the http component are incorrect regarding the HttpConstants class
The documentation on the wiki needs updating after many of the HTTP constants were moved from HttpConstants to Exchange in r777808.
The HttpConstants class is not even necessary anymore, the only constant remaining there is HttpConstants.CONTENT_ENCODING which is duplicated actually by Exchange.HTTP_CHARACTER_ENCODING.  The latter should be used, HttpConstants.java removed and the wiki updated.
