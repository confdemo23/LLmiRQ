EventDrivenPollingConsumer can lose exchanges when the internal queue is full
The exchange processing in the EventDrivenPollingConsumer can lose exchanges when the internal queue is bounded and full.
The implementation:

public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {

    queue.offer(exchange);

}



The reason is that BlockingQueue.offer(...) is non-blocking and returns a boolean which indicates whether the element was added.
However, the return value is ignored causing the exchange to get lost if it could not be added.
A potential workaround is to use an unbounded BlockingQueue (e.g. LinkedBlockingQueue).
