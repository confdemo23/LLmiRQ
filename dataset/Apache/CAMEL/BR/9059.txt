Jetty exposes its endpoint without component name
A simple route such as



        from("jetty:http://0.0.0.0:8080/ping").transform(constant("PONG\n"));



Enlists the jetty endpoint as just: http://0.0.0.0:8080/ping. But then its mistakenly the http component. It should be the full url with jetty as prefix.
