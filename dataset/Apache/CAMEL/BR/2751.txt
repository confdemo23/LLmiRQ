Timer Component is not Restartable
When the TimerComponent is stopped, it cancels all of the Timer instances it has created, which is good. However, TimerEndpoint keeps a local reference to the Timer instance, so if the TimerComponent is restarted, the TimerEndpoint will throw an exception as its timer is no longer usable as it has been canceled.
This patch provides a unit test, TimerRestartTest, and an update to TimerComponent that fixes this issue. The TimerComponent fix is to keep a list of all TimerEndpoints that have a reference to a Timer instance created by the TimerComponent. When TimerComponent.doStop is called, those TimerEndpoint references to the now canceled Timer instances are cleared.
