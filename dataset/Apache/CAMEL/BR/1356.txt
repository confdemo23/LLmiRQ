TryProcessor sets "caught.exception" header to in message, while there can be out already
Error exists in org.apache.camel.processor.TryProcessor.handleException(Exchange, Throwable). If your exchange has already out message (that can happen if you set out and then throw an exception. Then the exception caught is set on in message. When it reaches a pipeline it will be lost after first hop.
I believe TryProcessor should do what Pipelient does - copy out to in in new exchange if out exists.
