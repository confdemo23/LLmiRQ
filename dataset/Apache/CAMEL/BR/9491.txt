statement.maxRows not working as expected camel jdbc 
I have tested in
multiple versio*n i.e. 2.15.1,2.16.0,2.16.1 *also but still the same issue.
Camel JDBC component  statement.maxRows is not respected when query is fired repeatedly using a timer. It works fine only on the first run of the route after that the query gets all the records.
