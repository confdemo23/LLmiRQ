camel-mail thrown NotSupportedOperation for nntp protocol as not supporter (yet)
nntp is reserved for future implementation in camel-mail. Camel registers this protocol as supported by the autoscan of the META-INF files.
We should throw an exception to the end-user stating its not implemented yet.
Link to ticket that has the request for NNTP protocol support.
