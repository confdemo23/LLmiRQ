RedeliverErrorHandler - Should remove redeliver headers is failure processor is handling the caused exception
If for instance an onException() is handling a given exception the traces of the redelivery headers should be removed from the message.
As if the exchange will fail yet another again then it will continue using counters from where the old left. It should start from 0 again.
