camel-ahc-ws Consumer does not connect
WsEndpoint.connect(WsConsumer) should connect to the WebSocket server in case this is not already done. 
The test case (WsProducerConsumerTest.java) only works, since the producer is connecting first and the consumer is using the same connection. If no producer is used, then no connection is created and the consumer will not receive any messages.
Suggestion:



  void connect(final WsConsumer wsConsumer)

  {

    this.consumers.add(wsConsumer);



    if (this.websocket == null || !this.websocket.isOpen())

    {

      this.connect();

    }

  }
