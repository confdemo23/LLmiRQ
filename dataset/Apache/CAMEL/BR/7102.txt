Broken JUnit classes for testing authentication in camel-jcr
The following JUnit tests that are supposed to test authentication with the camel-jcr component are currently broken and disabled (annotated @Ignore):

AuthTokenLoginFailureTest
JcrAuthTokenWithLoginTest

Testing authentication in camel-jcr (i.e. connection URI parsing) is essential and should be fixed.
