Aggregator must be the only output added to the route is fooled by onException
See nabble:

We should convert the 
        if (!getOutputs().isEmpty()) 
{
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Aggregator must be the only output added to the route: " + this);
        }

nto a WARN log until we get the aggreagator fixed so you can define it anywhere in the route path. We have a ticket for this bug also.
