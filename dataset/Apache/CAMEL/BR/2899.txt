out of heap space if remote FTP site has too many files to pick up
2010-07-02 11:38:07,439 FATAL [org.apache.camel.component.file.remote.FtpConsumer:CamelThread 10]   - &lt;Consumer Consumer[my_ftp_URI_here caused by: Java heap space&gt;
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
My remote FTP server has ~60k 100 byte files, and the camel endpoint consumer falls over and doesn&amp;apos;t start again.  I can use JMX to stop/start the consumer, (it still has status "started") and it will log in to the remote server again, but then fall over with the out of heap space.
I can work around this by increasing the heap, or by moving some of the files aside,  but I don&amp;apos;t think camel should care how many files there are, or at least, I think it should deal with it more gracefully.
