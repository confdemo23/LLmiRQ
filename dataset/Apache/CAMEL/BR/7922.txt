MQTT endpoint misses QoS > 0 messages due to startup timing issue
When the MQTT Endpoint is started the MQTT connection is immediately established, causing an immediate influx of persisted messages (put on the topic when the client was not available). 
Issue is that at this point, most likely no consumers are available yet to process these messages.
Receiving a PUBLISH message
Publish message are received without any consumers. Result : msg with QoS &gt; 0 that were put on the topic while the client was not connected are never processed.

No consumers registered yet
Only when this finishes will Camel be able to process the messages.

These messages will never be picked up.
Perhaps it&amp;apos;s more the responsibility of the consumer / producer to start a connection when they get attached to the endpoint ?
