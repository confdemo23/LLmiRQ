Extra request parameter sent by the camel-jetty component
Trying to build a very simple HTTP proxy, exactly like described in the first code sample from http://camel.apache.org/how-to-use-camel-as-a-http-proxy-between-a-client-and-server.html.
Using wireshark to see exactly what is going on.
When i do a request on http://localhost:8080/myapp, the request that is sended to real server is http://realserverhostname:8090/myapp?bridgeEndpoint=true&amp;throwExceptionOnFailure=false.
when i do a parameterized request http://localhost:8080/myapp?toto=tata, the request that is sended to real server is http://realserverhostname:8090/myapp?toto=tata.
So when the when there is no request param, the endpoint parameter bridgeEndpoint=true&amp;throwExceptionOnFailure=false are sended to the realserver, and if there is param they are not sended.
