camel-aws - SQS option deleteAfterRead not work if set deleteIfFiltered=false
I&amp;apos;m using aws-sqs 2.17.3, if I set deleteAfterRead=true and deleteIfFiltered=false in my DSL, the message will not be deleted. If I want to delete the message after read it, I have to set deleteAfterRead and deleteIfFiltered both with true when I use the two options in one DSL, but in fact there is no filter in my route, the message should be removed whatever the deleteIfFiltered option set to ture or false.
SqsConsumerDeleteTest.java


from("aws-sqs:my-quque"

    + "?amazonSQSClient=#conn_cAWSConnection_1"

    + "&amp;deleteAfterRead=" + true + "&amp;deleteIfFiltered="

    + false).to("log:qs_route.cLog_1" + "?level=DEBUG").to("mock:mock_1");



I attached my test file, after run the test method, the sqs message still exists in the sqs queue after 30 seconds.
