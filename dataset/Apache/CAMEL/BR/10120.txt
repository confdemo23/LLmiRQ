Creating an InputStream from XMLStreamReader fails without default namespace
The XMLStreamReaderInputStream created by the StaxConverter will fail if the document does not define a default namespace, a tag contains an attribute without namespace prefix and the XMLStreamWriter from the JDK is used.
The error message is:
javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamException: NamespaceURI cannot be null
	at com.sun.xml.internal.stream.writers.XMLStreamWriterImpl.writeAttribute(XMLStreamWriterImpl.java:615)
	at org.apache.camel.converter.jaxp.XMLStreamReaderInputStream.ensureBuffering(XMLStreamReaderInputStream.java:106)
The fix is relatively simple: a check needs to be introduced that replaces null namespaceUris with empty namespace Uris.
The issue was introduced with CAMEL-10070.
The issue will not happen with unit tests because those use the woodstox Stax parser.
