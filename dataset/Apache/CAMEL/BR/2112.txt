Problem using a CamelTransportFactory from a junit 4 unit test or together with <context:annotation-config/>
I recently tried to convert my unit tests to junit 4 using the new Spring test framework.
Since then I get the following exception when calling the test.
Error creating bean with name &amp;apos;org.apache.camel.component.cxf.transport.CamelTransportFactory#0&amp;apos;: Injection of resource methods failed; nested exception is org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No matching bean of type [java.lang.String] found for dependency [collection of java.lang.String]: expected at least 1 bean which qualifies as autowire candidate for this dependency. Dependency annotations: {}
The same happens when I activate /&lt;context:annotation-config/&gt;/
I think it has to do with autowiring. Do you have any idea what goes wrong here and how I can fix it?
