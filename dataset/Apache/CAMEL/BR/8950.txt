Injected Quartz2 scheduler doesn&apos;t have access to CamelContext in jobs
Currently if you inject a scheduler the CamelContext won&amp;apos;t be available for jobs to access. When the scheduler is created automatically, the context is added to the quartz scheduler context so the jobs can access it:
quartzContext.put(QuartzConstants.QUARTZ_CAMEL_CONTEXT + "-" + camelContextName, getCamelContext());
