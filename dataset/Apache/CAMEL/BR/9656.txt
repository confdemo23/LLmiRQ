Using SpringBoot HealthEndpoint bean throws AmbiguousMethodCallException
I&amp;apos;m trying to re-use the Springboot Actuator HealthEndpoint and InfoEndpoint beans and exposing them via rest:



@Autowired

HealthEndpoint healthEndpoint;

...

//build the route

from("rest:get:health").routeId("REST-healthcheck").bean(healthEndpoint, "invoke");



However when that gets invoked, it throws a AmbiguousMethodCallException and its other candidate for "invoke()" is on the abstract class that HealthEndpoint is extending
It looks like the issue is here:
https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/camel-core/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/component/bean/BeanInfo.java#L1020
In this case HealthEndpoint extends AbstractHealthEndpoint, which is abstract, but invoke() is declared on the Endpoint interface. So this logic: 

 !isFromInterface &amp;&amp; Modifier.isAbstract(info.getMethod().getModifiers()) 

Will not evaluate to true, and the abstract method will remain a candidate.
Here are the sources for the Endpoint/HealthEndpoint/AbstractEndpoint classes:
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/master/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/endpoint/Endpoint.java#L56
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/master/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/endpoint/AbstractEndpoint.java#L32
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/master/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/endpoint/HealthEndpoint.java#L36
It seems this is intentional, due to the "if the class is an interface then keep the method" comment in BeanInfo.
I&amp;apos;m curious as to why that is.
