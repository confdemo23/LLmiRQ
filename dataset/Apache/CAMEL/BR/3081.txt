netty timeout exception
eventhough message was received by netty procuder, it thows a timeout exception after 30 secs. here is the route and log. as this is a basic functionality I think this is critical priority.
		from("netty:tcp://localhost:6205?textline=true&amp;sync=true").process(new Processor() {
		    int i=0;
			public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception 
{
		        String body = exchange.getIn().getBody(String.class);
				Thread.sleep(5000);
		        exchange.getOut().setBody("Bye 1" + body);
		       // if(i++%2==1) throw new IOException("custom exception");
		    }
		});
		from("file:///test/test/response")
		.convertBodyTo(String.class)
		.threads(1)
		.to(ExchangePattern.InOut,"netty:tcp://localhost:6205?textline=true&amp;sync=true")
		.to("log:+++ reply++++");
