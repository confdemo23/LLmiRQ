Include route builder as template for other routes to improve route reuse
It should be possible to include another route builder as a kind of template to improve route reuse.
The existing method addRoutes should either be change to support this properly or we add a new method.
However it does looks as if we could just tailor addRoutes method.
What needs also is to expose this in the Spring XML as well.
