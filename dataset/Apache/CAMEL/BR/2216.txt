camel-cxf should not relay on the default Bus
Sergey reported some bug  recently ,  after digging the code I found current camel-cxf&amp;apos;s get defaultBus code is not safe to use when we deploy the camel route into the JBI container or OSGi container.
So we need to create the new bus if there is no bus set into the camel-cxf endpoint.
