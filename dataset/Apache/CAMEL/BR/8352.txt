NettyServerBossPoolBuilder build() method is package-protected
The user documentation for camel-netty4 discusses creating worker and boss thread pools that are shared across camel-netty4 consumers.  I am trying to do this, but discovered that the NettyServerBossPoolBuilder.build() method is package-protected, and I am therefore unable to use this builder to create the shared boss pool.  Unit tests pass because the tests are within the same package, but the method needs to be public for anyone else to use.
