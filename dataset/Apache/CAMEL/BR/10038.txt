BlueprintPropertiesParser breaks propertyPlaceholder fallbackToUnaugmentedProperty behavior
When BlueprintPropertiesParser parses an "augmented" property key that is not found (i.e. value is null), it does not return the null value so that the fallbackToUnaugmentedProperty="true" (default) behavior can run. Instead, it immediately throws an IllegalArgumentException.
As a result, it appears to be impossible to take advantage of fallbackToUnaugmentedProperty="true" behavior when using the Blueprint properties resolver/parser.
I discovered this against Red Hat&amp;apos;s JBoss Fuse impl of Camel, but am reporting it here because it appears to be a bug in base Camel. More details in comments.
