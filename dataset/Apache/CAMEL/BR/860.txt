DeadLetterChannel does not set the EXCEPTION_CAUSE_PROPERTY
The DeadLetterChannel does not set the EXCEPTION_CAUSE_PROPERTY.
It looks like a bug in the method:
public boolean process(final Exchange exchange, final AsyncCallback callback, final RedeliveryData data) 
The property is set by getting the Exception from the exchange:
exchange.setProperty(EXCEPTION_CAUSE_PROPERTY, exchange.getException());
but several lines before the Exception ist set to null in exchange:
if (exchange.getException() != null) {
                Throwable e = exchange.getException();
                exchange.setException(null); // Reset it since we are handling it.
to fix the bug, i think it is simply done by preserving the Throwable like this
Throwable e = exchange.getException();
if (exchange.getException() != null) {
                exchange.setException(null); // Reset it since we are handling it.
...
exchange.setProperty(EXCEPTION_CAUSE_PROPERTY, e);
