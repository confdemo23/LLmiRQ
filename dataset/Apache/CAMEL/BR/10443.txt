findById does not work with ObjectId
When using Camel MongoDB component with "operation=findById" and [_id] field is happened to be a standard ObjectId(), it doesn&amp;apos;t work anymore in v.2.18 (worked 2.17.3 and before). 
Basically, to test you&amp;apos;d need to send org.bson.types.ObjectId in the message body but it never finds a document. 
The problem lies in MongoDbProducer.createDoFindById(). 
Can be fixed by replacing line: 
                String id = exchange1.getIn().getMandatoryBody(String.class); 
with 
                Object id = exchange1.getIn().getMandatoryBody();
