packageScan does not work with camel-blueprint
Using the following xml code does not activate the Java Camel routes that can be found in the given package;
&lt;blueprint xmlns="http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0"&gt;
	&lt;camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint"&gt;
		&lt;packageScan&gt;
			&lt;package&gt;eu.schuring.camel.blueprint.route&lt;/package&gt;
		&lt;/packageScan&gt;
	&lt;/camelContext&gt;
&lt;/blueprint&gt;
Attached is a usecase that should output messages from both a native blueprint DSL route and a Java DSL route activated by the xml section above. I&amp;apos;ve attached both the bundle and a source jar.
