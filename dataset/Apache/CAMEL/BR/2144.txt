A null-Message to a cxf-endpoint (e.g. HTTP-GET) can disable accepting regular requests
Start a fine configured system with came-cxf consumer endpoint using http. Make some tests with valid SOAP-Messages. Then just send a HTTP-Get-Request to the endpoint (e.g. with Browser). You&amp;apos;ll get some kind of Exception saying
java.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.cxf.message.MessageContentsList cannot be cast to org.w3c.dom.Node
Ok, this could be interpreted as "There is no content to convert into Node..." as, if you debug, you&amp;apos;ll see, that an empty MessageContentsList is provided by camel-cxf as the body of the camel message. Of course, if the Request would contain a body, the camel body would be a non empty MessageContentsList and the type converter mechanism would find a way to convert the list into a w3c Document, but that&amp;apos;s not the point. The Bug is, that this null-body-request puts the DefaultTypeConverter into a state, that let always return null for bodies of type MessageContentsList, even if it&amp;apos;s not empty (which is normal). I think that there is certain &amp;apos;misses&amp;apos;-map responsible for that kind of &amp;apos;miss&amp;apos;-state...
