CamelInvoker fail if operationName in the wsdl portype begin with uppercase
the generated method name in java file is always begin with lower case, but the operationName in the servicemodel begin with uppercase per the wsdl, this mismatch will cause the invocation fail throwing NO_OPERATION_FOUND exception
we should set CxfConstants.OPERATION_NAME as the one from servicemodel
