Marshaling using CSV will insert escape char in header if using a pipe as separator
This was an old bug that was supposedly resolved, but with version:2.15.2, the bug remains. The escape characters are still added into the Header Columns when marshaling back the object. 
e.g. 
Separator = \ \ |
Output: 
Header 1 \ | Header2 \ |...
Pls. advise when we can expect the fix.
Thanks.
