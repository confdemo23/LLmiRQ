Global exception not invoked in case of Exception fired while iterating through File Splitter
Hi All, 
I have written a file route which picks up xml files from a specified location. This file is passed to a splitter (actually an Expression written by me) which returns a custom made Iterator and returns to Camel. When camel is iterating through my iterator, if I throw RuntimeException, it is not getting caught in global exception and hence i am not able to log the error. In actual, my entire code is a test class attached with this mail. Anyone can run it directly. There is one strange behavior also noticed by me. If i throw RuntimeException from the Expression written by me, it is properly caught by the global exception. You can find both the occurance of RuntimeException in the code (the commented one is working properly). 
Any help will be appreciated.
