camel-xmpp processes no messages when running in Karaf
Camel XMPP communication is not working in version 2.15.3 when running in Karaf. The feature installation works fine but no messages are processed.
I guess this is potentially based on changing the Smack version from 3 to 4. 
Based on the existing Camel Karaf tests I created a simple test which passes with Camel Version 2.14.3 and fails with Camel Version 2.15.3. The test can be found here https://github.com/achim86/karaf-xmpp (remember to start the XMPPServer before running the test as described in the readme).
