Incorrect implementation of the method StringHelper.hasStartToken()
From the semantic point of view the method hasStartToken() should return false in case of an expression without language specified, i.e. starting with "${". 
However, it is correct to return true in current usage of hasStartToken() in camel-core, i.e. checking if an expression is in simple language, since if the expression does not contain the language token, then it is a simple expression.
The method calls for checking of simple language should be replaced with a newly created method isSimpleLanguage(String expression) that would check if the language is a simple expression, i.e. hasStartToken(expression, "simple") || expression.indexOf("${") &gt;= 0.
