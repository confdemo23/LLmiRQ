Strict Uri option validation fails HTTP Get Requests
The new strict URI validation requires that the named parameter options be validated prior to calling endpoint. This has the unfortunate side effect of failing exchanges to Endpoints where the parameter options are variable e.g. a GET request to HTTP server. In cases such as these it would be useful to be able to circumvent this strict validation.
The attached test illustrates the issue.
