Messages in Resequencer between 2 JMS queues get stuck
Martin describes the issue as follows in CAMEL-1034:
"The issue with the regular resequencer (the one that extends the BatchProcessor) remains because the process(Exchange) method is empty. In addition to the BatchProcessor&amp;apos;s polling consumer, an additional JmsConsumer is created by the JMS endpoint that competes with the polling consumer. The JmsConsumer then calls the empty process(Exchange) method and the exchange is lost."
