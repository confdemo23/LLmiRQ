StreamCache does not reset at the end of the pipeline
The StreamCache does not reset at the end of the pipeline.
The following routes will not work as expected:
   from("direct:c").noStreamCaching().to("direct:d").to("mock:c");
   from("direct:d").streamCaching().process(new TestProcessor());
(the test processor is a processor that reads the InputMessage)
If another processor is added after the TestProcessor that does nothing, the routes will work as expected.
This case is a bit synthetic, but in real life a route that starts with a InOut CXF endpoint, has an endpoint that generates a Stream and then writes the message content to an in only endpoint (file, FTP, log, etc.) will also fail, even if stream caching is enabled.
