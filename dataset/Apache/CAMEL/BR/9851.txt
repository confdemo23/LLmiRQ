Zookeeper RoutePolicy failing to create znode
I am trying to setup a ZooKeeper route policy like this
ZooKeeperRoutePolicy policy = new ZooKeeperRoutePolicy("zookeeper:localhost/regexTest1?create=true", 1);
from("direct:start").routePolicy(policy).to(mock:end);
And when I run my unit test to trigger the route, I get the following exception in my logs

Node &amp;apos;/regexTest1/192.168.202.25-3306c9d2-1354-4dbe-aaff-846eee5bb60d&amp;apos; did not exist, creating it.

It looks like it knows the znode doesnt exist but seems to be unable to create it? From the zookeeper server side logs, I can see incoming connections and it returning the error that the znode doesnt exist but doesnt look like theres any attempts to create it after that.
Ive tried using the zookeeper component directly in my route and I am able to create/write/read from a znode fine so it seems like its just failing in the route policy for some reason.
I am using Camel 2.17.0 and zookeeper 3.4.8
Ive investigated this further and the exception is thrown from the ZooKeeper.create method. Camel is actually trying to create a znode with a path /regexTest1/192.168.202.25-25829641-de1f-4389-9bb6-2967ea60de1a without creating the parent node /regexTest1 first. 
According to the Zookeeper.create method documentation 
"If the parent node does not exist in the ZooKeeper, a KeeperException

with error code KeeperException.NoNode will be thrown."

And I dont see anywhere in Camels code where it is creating the parent nodes first before attempting to create the final node for master election.
So I removed the path off the uri for the route policy like this
ZooKeeperRoutePolicy policy = new ZooKeeperRoutePolicy("zookeeper:localhost", 1);
And it has gotten past that error but now has encountered a different error where it has trouble creating a threadpool.
