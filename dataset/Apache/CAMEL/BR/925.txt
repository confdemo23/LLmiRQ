file component - should throw exception if can not delete or renamed consumed file
Currently it logs at WARN level that camel could not rename/delete the consumer file after processing.
However as end-users might not notice this "could be bigger problem" we should throw an IOException instead.
PS: The File API is terrible as it returns a boolean of this operation (will be fixed in NIO2 with a much better API).
The bigger problem is that if you don&amp;apos;t want to consume the file twice you should get a "exception" to track down the problem. WARN logs can be harder to track down.
