CsvDataFormat unable to setup header when useMaps="true"
Hi all,
 seems that it is impossible to setup the header of a csv when using a map.
It is always used the first line of the CSV file.
Using this configuration in conjunction with my patch I&amp;apos;m currently able to do so (also having the skipFirstLine flag working with useMaps="true")
Configuration:
