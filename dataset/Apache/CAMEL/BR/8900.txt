Javadoc parser in API Component Framework misses first method with void return type in JDK7
When using JDK 7 to generate Javadoc, the Javadoc parser based on javax.swing.text.html.parser.Parser fails to extract the first method if it has a void return type. For some reason the combination of the Javadoc generated by JDK7 and its Parser class gets the elements in the wrong order, causing the parser to go into the wrong state missing the first method. The next method element puts the parser back in the right state. 
The fix is to not let the parser come out of the METHOD_SUMMARY if it has not seen any methods at that point.
