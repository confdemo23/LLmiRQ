WS-Adressing: No headers in the respose, [MAPs retrieved from message null]
I am using a cxf endpoint configured in POJO mode and running in wsdl-first-approach. When a web-service client(Soap-UI) send a request with headers, it expects headers back with appropriate response Action defined in wsdl, however, with this configuration no headers are not being sent back.
Error seen on debug logs:
ContextUtils                   DEBUG retrieving MAPs from context property javax.xml.ws.addressing.context.inbound
ContextUtils                   WARN  WS-Addressing - failed to retrieve Message Addressing Properties from context
MAPAggregator                  DEBUG MAPs retrieved from message null

Please find attached detailed logs, a sample project, and a sample xml request.
