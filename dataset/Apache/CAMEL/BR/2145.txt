camel-http - creating http uri may contain special endpoint options
For example sending to an endpoint as follows

to("http://www.google.com?throwExceptionOnFailure=false");


Could potentially added throwExceptionOnFailure as a parameter but its an endpoint parameter not a HTTP parameter.
This issue is for components that build on top of camel-http.
