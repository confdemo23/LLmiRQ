ExchangeBuilder
We should add an ExchangeBuilder so you can use the builder pattern to create an Exchange and set message body, headers etc.
Something along the lines like this. Maybe there is a shorter and nicer API to do it:



Exchange exchange = ExchangeBuilder(context).withBody("Hello World).andHeader("foo", 123).build("activemq:queue:foo");
