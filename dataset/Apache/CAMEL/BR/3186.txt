@EndpointInject not working in bean created by blueprint
I am attaching a small test project that uses blueprint to create a camel context and a bean named Producer.  This project builds an OSGi bundle that I am deploying in FUSE ESB 4.3.0-fuse-01-00.  The Producer bean has an @EndpointInject annotation on a ProducerTemplate:
	@EndpointInject(ref = "testEndpoint")
	private ProducerTemplate testEndpoint;
The Producer bean&amp;apos;s init method sets a timer that tries to call testEndpoint.sendBody() once per second.  This throws a null pointer exception because the testEndpoint did not get injected:
07:35:31,826 | WARN  | Producer         | Producer                         | org.aaron.camel.Producer           51 | 118 - org.aaron.camel - 1.0.0.SNAPSHOT | send exception
java.lang.NullPointerException

This same test works perfectly if I use Spring DM to create the camel context and Producer bean.
