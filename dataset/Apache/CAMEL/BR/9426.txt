spring-boot with rest-dsl with api-doc registers multiple instances with multiple RouteBuilders
Spring-boot + swagger throws exception when there is another RouteBuilder component present:
org.apache.camel.spring.boot.CamelSpringBootInitializationException: org.apache.camel.FailedToStartRouteException: Failed to start route route4 because of Multiple consumers for the same endpoint is not allowed: Endpointhttp://0.0.0.0:10000/api-doc?httpMethodRestrict=GET
I used the same example as CAMEL-9247 but added an empty RouteBuilder component (AnotherRouter.java)
This makes it so we cannot have more than one RouteBuilder in our app.
