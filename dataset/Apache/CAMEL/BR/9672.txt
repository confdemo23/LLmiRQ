ClassCastException with interceptFrom
If a statement like



interceptFrom().when(simple("${header.foo} == &amp;apos;bar&amp;apos;")).to("mock:intercepted");



is available in a route builder with JMX enabled the startup will fail in Camel 2.16.2 (and the current 2.17-SNAPSHOT) with a ClassCastException in line 310 of DefaultManagementObjectStrategy.
The generated processor is a FilterProcessor, but the resulting definition is a WhenDefinition not a FilterDefinition.
The reason is that CAMEL-8992 introduced a too precise class check for this.
The attached patch relexes the class constraint on the definition.
