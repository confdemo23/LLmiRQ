PropertyPlaceHolder not loading Property, thinks it is a Parameter
When loading a standard rest service into Camel and setting up Swagger.



rest("{{BASE_URL}}").get("/{customerId}").description("...")...



The Base_URL portion is
1. interpreted as a parameter much like 
{customerId}
, i.e. the JSON displays: "
{BASE_URL}
" and "customerId" as the parameter name (removing outside curly brace)
2. the associated property is not loaded from the properties file
The Property Place Holder portion though works for the rest-dsl configuration:



 restConfiguration().apiProperty("api.title", "{{spring.application.name}}")
