Remove likeCompanyUpdate endpoint from camel-linkedin
Similar as CAMEL-8456. The underlying resource



/companies/{company-id}/updates/key={update-key}/is-liked



doesn&amp;apos;t exist. It was probably added by mistake instead of



https://api.linkedin.com/v1/people/~/network/updates/key={update-key}/is-liked



mentioned in the documentation https://developer-programs.linkedin.com/documents/commenting-and-liking-company-share. The resource is already mapped to linkedin://people/likeUpdate so there is no need to add it to companies prefixed endpoints.
