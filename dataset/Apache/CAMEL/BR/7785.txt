setUnitOfWork in DefaultExchange throws NPE when called from Splitter.java
setUnitOfWork in DefaultExchange throws NPE when called from Splitter.java, 
Line 226 of Splitter.java is: exchange.setUnitOfWork(null);
Line 372 of DefaultExchange.java checks if onCompletions !=null, in this case because Splitter.java initialized unitOfWork to null on line 376 unitOfWork.addSynchronization(onCompletion) will throw an NPE since unitOfWork is still null.
Recommendation:
Line 372 of defaultExchange.java should include a check if unitOfWork is not null:
if(onCompletions !=null &amp;&amp; unitOfWork != null)
Steps to reproduce:
1. Include a Split EIP in a Camel Route.
2. Specify an onPrepareRef=&lt;class&gt;
3. Add an onCompletion step to the exchange in &lt;class&gt;
4. NPE should be thrown when processing files.
