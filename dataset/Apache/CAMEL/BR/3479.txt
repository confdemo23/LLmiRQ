CamelContinuationServlet - May produce NPE under heavy load
CAMEL-2986 fixes some issue with the CamelContinationServlet.
However under extreme load and under some circumstances you can still get a NPE.
The Jetty guides for writing and using continuation at
http://wiki.eclipse.org/Jetty/Feature/Continuations
Shows a different style for suspend/resume than we currently have implemented. 
I think it&amp;apos;s best practice that we refactor the code in camel-jetty to be aligned with the Jetty guide.
I will follow the Suspend Resume Pattern style listed on the Jetty guide.
