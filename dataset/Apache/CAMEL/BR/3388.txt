@OutHeaders in bean binding issue with InOnly MEP
When you invoke a bean with a method signature like this in Camel 2.5.0/HEAD, the in and out message both are null (the "Hello!" value just disappears):



    public String doTest(@Body Object body, @Headers Map headers, @OutHeaders Map outHeaders) {

        return "Hello!";

    }



The same thing without the headers works OK:



    public String doTest(@Body Object body) {

        return "Hello!";

    }
