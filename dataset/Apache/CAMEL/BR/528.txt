Intermittent MailFetchSizeTest failure
I am seeing MailFetchSizeTest failing on my windows box.  After taking a look at the mock mailbox code, I think it is because mock mailbox (org.jvnet.mock_javamail.Mailbox) is not threadsafe.  If I add a half second sleep before checking mailbox.size() (see attached patch), it does not fail on my box anymore.  It is still not a guaranteed fix though.  I think we could remove the mailbox size checks if the "sleep" trick does not work because mock mailbox does not seem to support our testcase and we already verify messages on the receiving mock endpoint.
