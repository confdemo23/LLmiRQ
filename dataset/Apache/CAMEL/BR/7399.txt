Camel Salesforce integration tests fail with ClassNotFoundException
An upgrade to XStream version has broken the alias cache manipulation in XmlRestProcessor. Earlier versions of XStream used to only throw a ClassNotFoundException when CachingMapper.realClass call failed to find a mapped class, but recent versions now add the exception to its cache. This makes it imperative that the cache be flushed when no real class is found. As a result, the cache lookup optimization now only avoids flushing in case the alias mapping hasn&amp;apos;t changed, which still works for repeated invocation of the same endpoint which requires using an XML alias for Salesforce&amp;apos;s RESTish API.
