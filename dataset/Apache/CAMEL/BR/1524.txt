camel-irc URI parsing is flawed
the example URI for the camel-irc component (see http://camel.apache.org/irc.html) does not work.  Further, the current URI parsing code is flawed and subject to NPE&amp;apos;s.
In IrcConfiguration.configure(URI uri) (see https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/camel/branches/camel-1.x/components/camel-irc/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/component/irc/IrcConfiguration.java) the code attempts to parse a channel name as a path.  Because the &amp;apos;#&amp;apos; char is a fragment marker in a URI, the path (in the documented example) is zero length.
The following URI works with the current code implementation (note the required &amp;apos;//&amp;apos; and html-escaped &amp;apos;#&amp;apos; char):

irc://nick@server.org/%23channel
