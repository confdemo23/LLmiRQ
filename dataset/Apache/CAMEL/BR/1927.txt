FileConsumer preMove setting causes filename to be left in in progress repository.
If the FileConsumer preMove setting is used, then files are picked up the first time only, as the original file name is added to the in progress repository, whereas the new file name is removed from the in progress repository (though nothing is actually removed as the new file name is not in the in progress repository).
This causes a few problems:
i) If the maxMessagePerPoll is used, then messages not processed the first time are never picked up again.
ii) If the intention is to reprocess the same file, or a new file with the same name, then it will never be picked up again after the first time.
iii)  As the wrong file names are removed from the in progress repository, it results in a slow memory leak in the in progress repository.
