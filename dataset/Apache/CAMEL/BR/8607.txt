Camel endpoint RAW password unsafe characters
I am creating a camel endpoint such as this (somehost/someport/baseurl have been replaced):
https4://somehost:someport/baseurl?authenticationPreemptive=true&amp;authPassword=RAW(foo%bar)&amp;authUsername=RAW(username)
This causes camel to log the entire endpoint, including the user/password:
(DefaultComponent.java:67) - Supplied URI &amp;apos;https4://somehost:someport/baseurl?authenticationPreemptive=true&amp;authPassword=RAW(foo%bar)&amp;authUsername=RAW(username)&amp;apos; contains unsafe characters, please check encoding
Consider:
-It is a security issue to log the username/password
-Specifiying RAW would allow for special characters, specifically for passwords, as indicated here : https://camel.apache.org/configuring-camel.html, but it seems that UnsafeUriCharactersEncoder is not handling them appropriately.
