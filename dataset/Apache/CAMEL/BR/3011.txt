Using multiple CamelContext with quartz scheduler so keep track of the individual camel contexts
The default will by default only register the first CamelContext. Which is used in non statefull jobs to lookup endpoints etc.
Instead the camel-quartz component should keep track of all the different camel contexts and use the id of the context on the job so it can lookup the context.
