ThroughputLogger incorrectly reports duration 0
from the apache-camel-load test:
2008-11-14 15:27:01,114 [mponent@1296d1d] INFO  aset:myDataSet?produceDelay=10 - Sent: 600 messages so far. Last group took: 0 millis which is: 85.106 messages per second. average: 80.128
The ThroughputLogger used by DataSet resets the duration before reporting it.
