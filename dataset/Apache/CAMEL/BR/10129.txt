do not cache OSGi service by registry
OsgiServiceRegistry uses cache (serviceCacheMap) for services. If declarative services are provided by several bundles then keeping reference to those objects conflicts OSGi frameworks that support changing them at runtime.
serviceCacheMap should be removed or a new configuration option (enable/disable) should be added to easily disable caching.
