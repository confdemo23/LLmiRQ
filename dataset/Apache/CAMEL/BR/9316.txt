LevelDBAggregationRepository is logging warnings when exchange is already complete on first aggregation
When using an aggregator with a LevelDBAggregationRepository and you are sending events, that are already complete by themselves (i.e. the fulfill the completionPredicate and they were never really aggregated), there is a lot of warning logging like



Nov 12, 2015 6:00:57 PM org.apache.camel.component.leveldb.LevelDBAggregationRepository confirm

WARNUNG: Unable to confirm exchangeId [ID-LPNB2331-59378-1447347654170-0-939 from repository collectionNotifications: Not Found]



My guess is that calling confirm on the repository in such cases is unnecessary, but I&amp;apos;m not sure, if it is easy to detect wether confirm should be called or not.
