SoapMessageInInterceptor imports test generated code(pizza.types.CallerIDHeaderType)
org.apache.camel.component.cxf.interceptors.SoapMessageInInterceptor imports a class generated from test code 
import org.apache.camel.pizza.types.CallerIDHeaderType;
This makes life a bit annoying when trying to debug/develop with camel-cxf without generating the full test code.
