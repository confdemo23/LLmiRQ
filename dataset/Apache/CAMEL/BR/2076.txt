Setting global error handler in camel-spring may not work correctly
Really weird since recently upgrading junit in camel-spring some unit tests started failing based on global error handling configuration with camel-spring.
I have tracked it down to a bug how error handlers was resolved when using spring XML only. It always worked with Java DSL.
