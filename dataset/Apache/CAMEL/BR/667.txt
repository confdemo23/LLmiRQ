Transactional Client - Uses DeadLetterChannel to much
The new changes to the transactional client EIP pattern to let Camel support spring based TX does a trick to the DLC to set its max redeliveries to 1 if in transacted mode.
This causes the normal DLC code to be executed and it will report that in case of failures that its being handled by its error handler, this is normally to move it to an error queue.
This of course doesn&amp;apos;t happen. The DLC should be short cutted to let the underlying system handling the redelivery without the DLC infecting it currently.
