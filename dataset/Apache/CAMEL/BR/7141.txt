Custom HeaderFilterStrategy does not work when set it on either component or endpoint uri
Setting custom HeaderFilterStrategy on either NettyHttpComponent or NettyHttpEndpoint uri does not work. The only way to get it to work is to create a NettyHttpBinding bean and set the custom HeaderFilterStrategy as a property of the NettyHttpBinding bean and then set the custom NettyHttpBinding bean onto either NettyHttpComponent and NettyHttpEndpoint uri.
The reason it does not work was that when applying the custom HeaderFilterStrategy, it is not set on NettyHttpBinding object as the NettyHttpBinding object always uses default HeaderFilterStrategy. 
I have attached the patch file. It might not be necessary to modify NettyHttpComponent class but I thought it&amp;apos;d be better to initialize configuration, nettyBinding and headerFilterStrategy in their getter method only when needed rather than in constructor of the NettyHttpComponent.
