Xpath is not namespace aware in choice
I have a route (XML definition) containing a choice based on xpath expressions. The xpath expressions are using custom namespaces. After migration from camel 2.13.2 to camel 2.14.0 the namespaces are not registered to the XpathExpression and XPathBuilder anymore.
XPath in "setProperty" definitions referencing the same namespaces still work fine.
