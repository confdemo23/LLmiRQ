Some functionality broken in Camel-8857
Changes in Camel-8857 cause properties prefixing to not work for Camel context ID. See notes in https://github.com/apache/camel/commit/aa59cec696c46d4f9398ae91410998bd40fabbaa.
Also, backward compatibility to 2.12.0 is removed. See note in https://github.com/apache/camel/commit/c1b33e990ae5da7ca1e0268e79acc728393fd3ae.
Camel-8857 also had ABI changes that break existing bundles (requires rebuilding them all).
