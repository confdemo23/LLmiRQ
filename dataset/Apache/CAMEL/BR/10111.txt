Creating an InputStream from XMLStreamReader fails with ASCII default platform encoding
If a type conversion is performed between XMLStreamReader and the platform default encoding is not UTF-8 and the used Stax parser is the one from the JDK the conversion will fail.
The error message will look like that:
Caused by: javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamException: Underlying stream encoding &amp;apos;ASCII&amp;apos; and input paramter for writeStartDocument() method &amp;apos;utf-8&amp;apos; do not match.
The underlying issue was introduced with CAMEL-10070 and CAMEL-10080.
Unfortunately this cannot be unit tested, as in the unit tests the default platform encoding is UTF-8 and the used Stax parser is woodstox. Both conditions prevent the issue from occuring.
