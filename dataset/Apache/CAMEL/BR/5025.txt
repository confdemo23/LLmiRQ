The ErrorHandler doesn&apos;t work when Splitter working in Streaming model.
When the Splitter working in Streaming model, the error handle does work if the exception is throw from body iterator.



errorHandler(deadLetterChannel("mock:error"));

from("direct:start").

	split(body()).						

		streaming().

		to("mock:end").

	end();



Here is the mail thread[1] which discusses about it.
