Splitter Component: Setting &apos;streaming="true" parallelProcessing="true"&apos; consumes large amounts > of heap space for big original messages
Setting &amp;apos;streaming="true" parallelProcessing="true"&amp;apos; consumes large amounts of heap space for big original messages. E.g. 1024m of heap is not enough to process an 80Mb with 500&amp;apos;000 lines, splitting it line by line.
The problem seems to be the ArrayList in MulticastProcessor line 224. It contains a Future&lt;Exchange&gt; object for every token delivered by the java.util.Scanner. The list is only cleared (going out of scope) after all Future objects have been completed.
