swagger - Model schema not including nested objects
This issue relates to the new camel-swagger-java component and not the camel-swagger component. JIRA is not yet updated for the new camel-swagger-java component.
When there are nested objects in the Api model for swagger, they are not being represented correctly in the model schema. See below for an example:
SomeRequest.java


@ApiModel

public class SomeRequest {

    @ApiModelProperty

    private List&lt;SomeObject&gt; someObjects;

    ...

}



SomeObject.java


@ApiModel

public class SomeObject {

    @ApiModelProperty

    private String somePropertyOne;

    @ApiModelProperty

    private String somePropertyTwo;

    ...

}



Should have a model in swagger of:



{ 

  "someObjects": [ 

    { 

      "somePropertyOne": "", 

      "somePropertyTwo": "" 

    } 

  ] 

}



But instead has:



{ 

  "someObjects": [ 

    "SomeObject" 

  ] 

}



This model is invalid and makes the swagger documentation useless as no one knows what the request model is supposed to be.
Note: this worked correctly on camel 2.15.3 with the scala based camel-swagger component.
