ClassLoadingAwareObjectInputStream cannot handle deserializing proxies with mixed JDK & non-JDK interfaces
The camel-sql component contains a class called ClassLoadingAwareObjectInputStream, which is a copy from a class from the apache activeMQ project.
There was a bug in this class that was fixed in the activeMQ project but was not updated in the camel-sql component.
I face the same issue as in: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-3537
where I cannot deserialize an object that contains a mix of jdk and non-jdk classes.
