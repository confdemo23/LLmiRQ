Restlet component is URL encoding the POST message body.  It should encode it based on content-type request header.
I attempted to POST a JSON document to couchdb via restlet.  The post fails with and "Invalid JSON format" error from couchdb.  This is because the POST data was being URL encoded which substitutes %XX sequences for all the curly braces.  I believe the encoding should be done based on the content-type header, or possibly not at all for POST requests.
