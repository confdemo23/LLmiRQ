enableTrace of the Main class doesn&apos;t work
The enableTrace() method of the Camel Main class doesn&amp;apos;t work.
When we setup the code as such



    public static void main(String... args) throws Exception {

        Main main = new Main();

        main.enableHangupSupport();

        main.addRouteBuilder(new MyRouteBuilder());

        main.enableTrace();

        main.run(args);



and launch the Main class, than the messages reported by the route in the log are not traced at all.
If we debug, we can see that there is not CamelContext object when this method of the MainSupport class is called



    public void enableTrace() {

        this.trace = true;

        for (CamelContext context : camelContexts) { // EMPTY

            context.setTracing(true);

        }

    }



The workaround is to enable the tracing within the route definition



    public void configure() {



        getContext().setTracing(true);
