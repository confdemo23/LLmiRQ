Avoid using InputStreamEntity for byte[] input
Sending byte[] input via http in some circumstances causes ugly NonRepeatableEntityException because of the internal usage of InputStreamEntity in the HttpEntityConverter which is not repeatable. The usage of ByteArrayEntity seems more resonable for this input.
A workaround is to explicitly convertbodyto string but this is taken with care because of encoding when creating string and StringEntity later on!
