routeBuilder ref not working in camel 2.5.0
 I amended the camel-example-osgi project so as to use the Java RouteBuilder, the MyRouteBuilder class in that project
I changed the blueprint.xml file to the following
	&lt;bean id="routeBuilder" class="org.apache.camel.example.osgi.MyRouteBuilder" /&gt;
	&lt;camelContext xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint"&gt;
			&lt;routeBuilder ref="routeBuilder"/&gt;
	&lt;/camelContext&gt;
However nothing happens, no error message is displayed either.
If I leave the example in its original state, in other words using the xml-based dsl, then it works.
Maybe this is somehow related to the fact that packageScan does not work???
