Camel JGroups does not disconnect shared JChannel correctly
Camel JGroups component uses a JGroups JChannel object in JGroupsEndpoint, which is shared by its JGroupsProducer and JGroupsConsumer. 
However, both the producer and consumer call disconnect() independently in their doStop() methods. This can leave a producer or consumer disconnected if the other is stopped.
The channel connect/disconnect could use a shared counter to determine when the channel should be disconnected.
