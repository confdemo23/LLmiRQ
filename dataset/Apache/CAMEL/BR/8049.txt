DefaultRestletBinding can not deal with multi-valued HTTP request parameters
Multi-valued HTTP request parameters are a common practice yet, with the provided binding, Camel Restlet component can not deal with them.
In DefaultRestletBinding, we can see the following problematic code:



public void populateRestletRequestFromExchange(Request request, Exchange exchange) {

...

     form.add(key, value.toString());

...

}



where the value is always treated as a String, even though it can be a Collection.
And similarly:



public void populateExchangeFromRestletRequest(Request request, Response response, Exchange exchange) throws Exception {

...

     for (Map.Entry&lt;String, String&gt; entry : form.getValuesMap().entrySet()) {

          ...

     }

...

}



where getValuesMap() effectively disregards all duplicate key names.
