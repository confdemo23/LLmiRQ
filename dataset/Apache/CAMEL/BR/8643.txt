Http Post from a streaming client sometimes fails to parse
When upgrading from camel 2.14.1 to 2.15.0 our http posts from clients were sometimes failing.  Traced issue to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-5806.  The linked issue added a check of InputStream.available() which on a slow or remote client the binary stream isn&amp;apos;t always immediately available.  Since this is done as part of the initial setup the data is never parsed when it becomes available.
