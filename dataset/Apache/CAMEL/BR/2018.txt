Timer Endpoint starts the thread before configuration
The Timer endpoint does not appear to allow configuration using Spring XML.  When debugging, the Timer is created (with default configuration) and then the configuration magic happens
TimerComponent.createEndpoint calls
new TimerEndpoint() which calls
component.getTimer(this)
Which creates the timer before the properties are set
