VetoCamelContextStartException with rethrowException=false cases MainSupport class to hang
Hi,
I just created my own LifecycleStrategy implementation, that performs some sanity checks on context startup, and throws a VetoCamelContextStartException if it detects a problem. But since I only want a user friendly error message to be printed, and no stack trace, I opted to have rethrowException=false. That caused Camel to abort the start of the context. But it keeps the process running, instead of letting it terminate. If I use rethrowException=false the process terminates as expected.
When debugging this in Eclipse, I see that Camel get stuck in the method waitUntilCompleted() in org.apache.camel.main.MainSupport.
I use Apache Camel 2.17.0, Camel Spring (XML), and start the process using org.apache.camel.spring.Main. When asking about this behaivor in the user mailing list, Claus Ibsen hinted that this is a bug that I should report here. Apparently the Main class doesn&amp;apos;t handle the veto properly.
