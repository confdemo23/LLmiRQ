BeanInvocation handling LinkedHashMap cannot be converted to java.util.Map
I&amp;apos;m calling a Camel proxy and passing it a single argument of type LinkedHashMap.
On the service side I&amp;apos;m waiting for a java.util.Map, so the converter BeanInvocation -&gt; java.util.Map is called.
Finally it comes to BeanConverter:convertTo with type=java.util.Map and value class=BeanInvocation
then it goes to
            // maybe from is already the type we want
            if (from.isAssignableFrom(type)) 
{
                return body;
            }
where from=LinkedHashMap
and... the condition is false!
The LinkedHashMap is not assignable from java.util.Map,
but java.util.Map is assignable from LinkedHashMap and, I guess, that is what we want.
Please fix?

if (from.isAssignableFrom(type)) {
+ if (type.isAssignableFrom(from)) {
