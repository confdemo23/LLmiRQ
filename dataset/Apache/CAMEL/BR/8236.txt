WebSphere class loader detection is too sensitive
The DefaultCamelContext attempts to detect an IBM WebSphere application server by a simple test: loader.getClass().getName().startsWith("com.ibm")
This test can introduce very subtle bugs when working with other IBM productes and I suggest to replace it by a list of known class names of WebSphere class loaders. At least, one should add an additional dot in order to avoid matching packages that only start with "com.ibm" such as any "com.ibmfoobar".
