Tracer incorrectly treats messages with InputStream as body
Suppose we have the following flow:
 from("activemq:vasea")
  .to("cxf:bean:serviceEndpoint?dataFormat=MESSAGE")
    .unmarshal().string()
  .to("activemq:petea");
In this flow cxf:bean:serviceEndpoint returns ByteArrayInputStream as body. Under normal conditions everything works fine: WS output gets to the queue.
But if we add:
getContext().addInterceptStrategy(new Tracer());
Queue starts receiving empty messages. After digging in the code I found out that tracer reads input stream in order to display body, but not resets it. Thus when message reaches unmarshaller, nothing could be read from the stream.
