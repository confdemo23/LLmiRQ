Restlet - Need to run in sync mode due bug in restlet
There is a NPE bug in restlet when the restlet client timeout
https://github.com/restlet/restlet-framework-java/issues/871
This causes camel restlet producer to not have its callback called, which can lead to Camel hanging.
We need to force sync mode until restlet fixes their NPE bug
