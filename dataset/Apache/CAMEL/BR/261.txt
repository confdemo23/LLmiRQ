patch to fix some issue about camel-cxf component
this patch 
1.
@override
    protected boolean useIntrospectionOnEndpoint() 
{
        return false;
    }
to let parameter start with "soap." passed in soap endpoint
2. use
WSDLServiceFactory factory = new WSDLServiceFactory(getBus(), getWsdlURL(), getServiceQName());
instead of
WSDLServiceFactory factory = new WSDLServiceFactory(getBus(), getWsdlURL(), null);
so that can pass in servicename to WSDLServiceFactory, in case that more than one service in the wsdl, we can specify the one we want
3. add wait response into CxfProducer, so that if the MEP is not oneway, we can waiting for the response in certain period
4. add more type convert for CxfSoapBinding and CxfBinding, so that we can handle message body more than InputStream .
