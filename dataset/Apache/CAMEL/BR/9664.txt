DefaultRestletBinding.populateRestletRequestFromExchange uses wrong mediaType comparison
We are trying to bind an incoming POST REST call with Content-Type application/x-www-form-urlencoded to an outgoing one. The incoming request body containing the url encoded form does not get transferred to the outgoing one. We investigated and saw there&amp;apos;s a bug in 
DefaultRestletBinding.populateRestletRequestFromExchange:180 (2.16.2):
if (request.getMethod() == Method.GET || (request.getMethod() == Method.POST &amp;&amp; mediaType == MediaType.APPLICATION_WWW_FORM)) {
The mediaType gets compared using ==. This is wrong. The condition always evaluates to false although the configured Content-Type within the header is "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" (or in our case "application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=ISO-8859-1").
