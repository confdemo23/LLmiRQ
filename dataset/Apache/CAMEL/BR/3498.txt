Splitter Component: Setting &apos;streaming = "true"&apos; breaks error handling
Setting &amp;apos;streaming = "true"&amp;apos; breaks error handling:
If an exception is thrown in a processor, the exception in the subExchange is copied to the original exchange in MulticastProcessor line 554. In Splitter line 140 the original exchange is copied, including the exception that was thrown while processing the previous exchange. This prevents all subsequent exchanges from being processed successfully.
