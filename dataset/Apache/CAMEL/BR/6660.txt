JMX - Using custom @ManagedResource and extending default components can cause some attributes to be unavailable
Related to CAMEL-6586
Its when you use a custom @ManagedResource such as in a custom component, then some of the out of the box attributes such as camelId, state, etc may be shown as Unavailable in JMX consoles.
Its the MBean assembler and JMX in general that needs to find some way of being able to mixin the custom attributes/operations with the out of the box ones. So you dont have to copy the out of the box attributes to your custom classes.
