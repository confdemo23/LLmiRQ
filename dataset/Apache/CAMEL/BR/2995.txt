charset parser should cater for quotes, both single and double quotes

I bet many systems may report charset in different ways such as

Content-Type:text/xml;charset="utf-8" 
Content-Type:text/xml;charset=&amp;apos;utf-8&amp;apos; 
Content-Type:text/xml;charset=utf-8 


We should ensure that we support all ways of setting this. And there may also be spaces between so we should trim and whatnot.
The code in 2.4 may have been improved. Just creating a ticket to be sure.
