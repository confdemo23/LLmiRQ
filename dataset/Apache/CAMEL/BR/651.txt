BeanProcessor more intelligent choosing of correct method (AOP proxies problems)
The example: example-spring-jms using AOP proxies as a part of the enhancer server demonstration to do somekind of audit tracking using aspectj and spring.
However Camel now have trouble picking the correct method (broken in later 1.4-SNAPSHOT) or as the AOP proxied object now has an removeAdvisor(int) method that Camel think it can invoke also.
However the BeanInfo#chooseMethodWithMatchingBody method doens&amp;apos;t consider the MEP pattern (InOut etc). So when there is an Out pattern the method should not be void.
