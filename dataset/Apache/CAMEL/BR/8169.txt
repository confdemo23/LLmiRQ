Camel Jetty/Http4 producers should respect Content-Length/Transfer-Encoding:Chunked headers
If Camel is used the HTTP proxy, users expect that Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding: Chunked headers should be respected when incoming request is redirected using HTTP4 or Jetty producers.
If example if I send request to the following route...



from("servlet://0.0.0.0:8080").to("http4://foo.com"); 



...and this request contains Content-Length header (and doesn&amp;apos;t contain Transfer-Encoding: Chunked header) then request forwarded to foo.com should not be chunked. In Fuse 6.1 Camel will chunk frowarded request.
In general client sending request to the Camel proxy gateway, should be sure that by default Camel will keep the same chunking/nonchunking behavior as specified in the original request.
