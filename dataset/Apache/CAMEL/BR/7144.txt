Blueprint route not shutdown when using OSGi service processor
The route description uses .toString() when shutting down. This causes the shutdown to block if a proxied OSGi service is used as processor (in XML DSL &lt;process ref="osgiService/&gt;) and the service is not present at the time the route is shut down.
