Camel-box socks proxy implementation is incomplete
org.apache.camel.component.box.internal.LoginAuthFlowUI looks for http.route.socks-proxy and sets up a socks proxy for the webClient
org.apache.camel.component.box.internal.BoxClientHelper just passes the httpParams on to the underlying HttpClient but the box api uses a vanilla DefaultHttpClient which doesn&amp;apos;t talk SOCKS.
The attached patch adds socks proxy support to the main restful box transactions.
