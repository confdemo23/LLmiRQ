BlueprintCamelContext OSGi service is not unregistered when context is stopped
org.apache.camel.core.osgi.OsgiCamelContextPublisher doesn&amp;apos;t receive CamelContextStoppingEvent because org.apache.camel.util.EventHelper#doNotifyEvent() checks for started state and org.apache.camel.core.osgi.OsgiCamelContextPublisher is never started.
