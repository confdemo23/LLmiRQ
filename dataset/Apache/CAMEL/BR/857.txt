DeadLetterChannel - maximum redelivery is not corrent and redelivery counter is wrong when failure handled
The unit test from CAMEL-794 demonstrates a few issues with the DLC in Camel

the maximum redelivery is not reached - eg. setting it to 2 will only perform 1 normal attempt + 1 redelivery, and not as expected 2 redeliveries
when the exchanged could not be redelivered at all then the redeliverycounter has already been incremented and thus is off by +1
