File consumer - Consuming from absolute paths can cause issue on Windows when moving file when done
When using a file consumer with an absolute path, eg from("file:/data") then when the process is done and it wants to move the file to .camel sub dir of /data it may not do that correctly on Windows.
The issue is the logic in Camel is based upon that a path starting with \ is considered absolute, as it is on Unix OS and other platforms. Where as on Windows java.io.File returns false for such files. The other return true. So we need to cater for this and make Windows return true as well so the logic is consistent across OS.
