Component for Apache Kafka
I have written a component for Apache Kafka. 
If someone makes a blank wiki page I will edit it for documentation.
Kafka uses Apache license obviously. The other dependencies are https://github.com/sgroschupf/zkclient and https://github.com/codahale/metrics which are both Apache also.
