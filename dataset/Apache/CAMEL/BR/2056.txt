Optional charset parameter in convertBodyTo is ignored by most converters in IOConverter
Most of the converters in IOConverter that do a char &lt;-&gt; byte conversion ignore the charset given as second argument to convertBodyTo. The attached patch fixes this.

For relevant converter methods, it introduces an additional second Exchange parameter from which the desired charset is obtained.
For backwards compatibility to code that uses the IOConverter directly, a one-parameter version of these methods was kept but the @Converter annotation was removed (Camel doesn&amp;apos;t allow overloaded static type converter methods to be registered i.e. they overwrite in other in the registry).
The patch furthermore removes existing redundancies in code like getting the charset from the exchange, check if the exchange is null etc.
The String-&gt;byte[] converter from ObjectConverter was moved to IOConverter because its implementation is more closely related to other methods in this converter class.
