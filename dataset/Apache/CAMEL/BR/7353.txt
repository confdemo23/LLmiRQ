Configuring an http4 endpoint with hostname starting with "http" leads to an URISyntaxException
Trying to configure an endpoint like



http4://http.org



where the hostname starts with the characters "http" leads to an URISyntaxException "Expected scheme-specific part at index http4:"
This behaviour is caused by the following lines in camel-http4&amp;apos;s HttpComponent (around line 211):



        // need to set scheme on address uri depending on if its secure or not

        String addressUri = remaining.startsWith("http") ? remaining : null;



In our case, the hostname is not prefixed with http:// or https:// which leads to the mentioned exception.
The code in question was introduced within CAMEL-6880. I&amp;apos;m not shure why the variable remaining is checked for a protocol prefix as it already comes without one. Setting



        String addressUri == null;



would solve the problem and does not break any test.
