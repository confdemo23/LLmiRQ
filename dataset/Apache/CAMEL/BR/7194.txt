[cxfrs] Bus features aren&apos;t initialized

CxfRsEndpoint doesn&amp;apos;t support custom feture support like
org.apache.camel.component.cxf.CxfEndpoint.setFeatures(List&lt;AbstractFeature&gt;)
org.apache.camel.component.cxf.jaxrs.CxfRsEndpoint.createJAXRSClientFactoryBean() can&amp;apos;t be used for additional configuration because org.apache.camel.component.cxf.jaxrs.CxfRsProducer.ClientFactoryBeanCache used
in case bus was initialized with required features they aren&amp;apos;t initialized for WebClient
