Loading routes using loadRouteDefinition from CamelContext lacks some logic from camel-core-xml
We have shared logic in camel-core-xml to use when build / loading routes from XML using JAXB. The routes must be prepared before they are usable for creating the runtime processors.
The logic should be moved into camel-core in the model package so we have it centralized and its more easy to reuse
