MessageHistory stores passwords in plain text
The MessageHistory feature currently keeps passwords in plain text in case they are part of the URI. 
MessageHelper.doDumpMessageHistoryStacktrace() does some sanitizing, but only for the from node - other nodes/processors are currently not sanitized. 
In order to prevent handling sensitive information in the message history in general, I would suggest to sanitize the URI already when storing a MessageHistory item.
