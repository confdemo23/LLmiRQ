Cache Component configuration requires MemoryStoreEvictionPolicy instance, will not accept parameter as part of URI
In Spring, if one attempts to specify a cache endpoint as:
&lt;endpoint id="myCache" uri="cache://MyCache?memoryStoreEvictionPolicy=MemoryStoreEvictionPolicy.FIFO"/&gt;
an exception will be thrown that the String "MemoryStoreEvictionPolicy.FIFO" was not a proper Java Object and no TypeConverter is available. This can be worked-around by manually creating a type converter that performs:
    String policyName = evictionPolicy.replace("MemoryStoreEvictionPolicy.", "");
    return MemoryStoreEvictionPolicy.fromString(policyName);
Or one could just try to create a new instance from reflection. Above way is a bit more manageable however, since EhCache is taking care of the conversion for you.
