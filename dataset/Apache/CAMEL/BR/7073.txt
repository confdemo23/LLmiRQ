camel-restlet - request headers are sent in response
The fix applied in CAMEL-6879 causes the request headers to be sent back in the response.
DefaultRestletBinding copies the request headers in &amp;apos;org.restlet.http.headers&amp;apos; header to the response headers in &amp;apos;org.restlet.http.headers&amp;apos;.
This causes problems for things like Content-Type header which is a valid request and response header and so the response is sent with the request content-type. Eg, POST requests that should receive JSON in response and send using content-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded will be sent back a response with the same content-type which doesn&amp;apos;t make sense.
