Processor invocation order
Please see attached patch to reproduce.
I made a small change to an existing unit test and created a route like this:
from("direct:a").intercept(interceptor1).process(orderProcessor).intercept(interceptor2).to("direct:d"); 
I think one would expect to have one route and the invocation order to be interceptor1 -&gt; orderProcessor -&gt; interceptor2 -&gt; direct:d.
Instead we have:
1. two routes
1. interceptor1 and interceptor2 are invoked twice
2. orderProcessor is never invoked
3. direct:d is invoked twice, i think.
