Problem with scanning Jar files for Converters if application is loaded with webstart
I&amp;apos;ve encountered a problem with the scanning of jar files with the @Converter annotation if the Jars are loaded with the webstart classloader. Because the URL starts with http: the conversion to a file fails in ResolverUtil. 
I&amp;apos;ve attached a patch that uses an UrlResource if the url starts with http: and this works if the jar-resource has the version information added to the jar file in the JNLP-file (like &lt;jar href="camel-core-1.4-SNAPSHOT.jar"/&gt;). But if the version is added separately (like &lt;jar href="activemq-core.jar" version="5.1.0"/&gt;) it fails because the classloader returns the name of the jar-file without the version information (like http://....../activemq-core.jar) and this file does not exist. 
I&amp;apos;m currently trying if it is possible to check whether the application is started via webstart (there is a class Tool that should only exist in the webstart classloader) and in this case I&amp;apos;ll check if the filename of the jar-file is returned correctly. If yes maybe we can provide another patch to get rid of the problem described above.
