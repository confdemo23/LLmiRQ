Context component conflates endpoints with the same local id from different CamelContexts
The context component experiences clashes between endpoints with the same local name, but from different contexts.  If two contexts both contain a local endpoint "direct:out", any route involving both endpoints will fail to start due to a FailedToStartRouteException; "Multiple consumers for the same endpoint is not allowed: Endpoint[direct://out]."
As an example, the following set of routes will fail due to this issue:
from("direct:in").to("blackBox:in");
from("blackBox:out").to("direct:out");
from("direct:out").to("mock:results");
