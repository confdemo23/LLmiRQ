[Avro] Issue on OSGi due to static cache
Avro holds a cache of classloaders and other reflection related classes in a static map here:
https://github.com/apache/avro/blob/master/lang/java/avro/src/main/java/org/apache/avro/specific/SpecificData.java#L52-L57
Keys of that map are {{String}}s with classname.
The cache is never updated, and this breaks OSGi ability to update a new class definition, since avro will keep pointing to the old version.
This will lead to a situation where, on an OSGi platform, you are exposed to ClassCastException since the rest of the platform might see a different varsion than the old one cached by avro.
The attached fix is a simple way to entirely bypass this caching behavior with just public subclasses that turn off just the caching behavior.
