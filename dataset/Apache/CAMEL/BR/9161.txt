Camel spring-boot not finding routes when using spring-cloud
On startup Camel is not registering any routes annotated with @Component. Route is found and registered in Spring just fine. Switch to version 2.15.2 and it works fine. 
No errors are thrown, and everything says it&amp;apos;s started, but no routes are active or reported as being found during startup. 
Application is being run through `mvn spring-boot:run` if that makes a difference.
