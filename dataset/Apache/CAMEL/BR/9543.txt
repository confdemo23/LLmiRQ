Discovering new type converters in OSGi wipes out those manually added
When adding a type converter manually like:



getContext().getTypeConverterRegistry().addTypeConverter(A.class, B.class, new ABConverter()); 



It gets removed from the type converter registry when a new type converter is discovered in a newly installed bundle. (Like when you install camel-hl7 feature in Karaf say).
