StreamCachingInterceptor can be enabled both as a strategy and as an interceptor -- should only be a strategy

explicitly enable it through the DSL
implicitly enable it through e.g. a Multicast or DeadletterChannel

We should make that a single way of enablement or else document the rationale for the difference properly.
