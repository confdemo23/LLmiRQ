Avoid clash of CamelContext managementName in OSGi
There can be a potential clash in OSGi when there are 2+ camelContext in the same bundle, as they will by default reuse the same managementName in the mbean naming, where it uses the symbolic name of the OSGi bundle.
We should detect this clash and use the counter to make it unique.
This is part of CAMEL-6972
