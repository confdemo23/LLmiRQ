Using static queue as a reply queue in InOut pattern causes memory leak
I am running JBoss, ActiveMQ and Camel for my application.   In the InOut pattern,  I am using a predefined static queue as a reply queue.   After running for a while,  the memory usage of JBoss keeps growing and growing until it hits outOfMemory error and app server is totally hung.   I monitor the thread in jconsole,  I can see the jms connection/session keeps growing and growing.   
But once I switch to use temp queue for InOut pattern,  this problem goes away.
