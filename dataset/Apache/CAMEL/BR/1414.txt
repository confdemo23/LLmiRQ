JMSMessage vanishes attachments
When using this kind of route
&lt;from uri="activemq:queue:test"/&gt;
&lt;camel:process ref="mailProcessor" /&gt;
&lt;to uri="smtp://localhost:25?to=user@localhost" /&gt;
and trying to enrich the message in the mailProcessor with
exchange.getIn().addAttachment("attachement.txt",
                new DataHandler("Hello world", "text/plain"));
The received mail doesn&amp;apos;t contains any attachment.
If the input "from" is a "direct" instead of activemq, it works fine.
Inspecting source code,  MessageSupport.copyFrom(Message that) does
getAttachments().putAll(that.getAttachments());
but the child class JmsMessage doesn&amp;apos;t.
