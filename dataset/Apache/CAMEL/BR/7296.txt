camel-hbase component have some bugs on Consumer side
After I tried a little bit, I think there are 2 problems on Consumer side:

Returned value is null
if we specified family and qualifier options in URI, then all returned values will be null.  I did some investigation, and I found the problem is caused by the equals method of HBaseCell class. In poll() method of HBaseConsumer, the resultRow will apply rowModel first before insert the resultCell, see below code:



             ....

              HBaseData data = new HBaseData();

                HBaseRow resultRow = new HBaseRow();

                resultRow.apply(rowModel);       //the existing HBaseCell in rowModel will be insert into resultRow

                byte[] row = result.getRow();

                resultRow.setId(endpoint.getCamelContext().getTypeConverter().convertTo(rowModel.getRowType(), row));



                List&lt;KeyValue&gt; keyValues = result.list();

                if (keyValues != null) {

                    for (KeyValue keyValue : keyValues) {

                        String qualifier = new String(keyValue.getQualifier());

                        String family = new String(keyValue.getFamily());

                        HBaseCell resultCell = new HBaseCell();

                        resultCell.setFamily(family);

                        resultCell.setQualifier(qualifier);

                        resultCell.setValue(endpoint.getCamelContext().getTypeConverter().convertTo(String.class, keyValue.getValue()));

                        resultRow.getCells().add(resultCell); //will fail to insert if some cell with same Family and Qualifier exists

                    }

                    ...

              }



that means we can&amp;apos;t specify family and qualifier option when consuming.
remove option
the default value of remove option is true, that mean, after scan the table, all scanned row will be removed. I think it&amp;apos;s not we expect, so user may have to add option remove=false to stop that. however this option doesn&amp;apos;t describe on website http://camel.apache.org/hbase.html .

Besides these problem, I think some descriptions on http://camel.apache.org/hbase.html are not correct, for example the demos and Header Options. please have a check.
