Issue with password having double &&
there is an issue with handling password with double &amp;&amp; even when wrapping it into RAW() constraint 
For instance the use of URI 
http://hostname/script.php?authMethod=Basic&amp;authPassword=RAW(pa&amp;&amp;word)&amp;authUsername=usr
throws the exception: 
org.apache.camel.ResolveEndpointFailedException: Failed to resolve endpoint: http://hostname/script.php?authMethod=Basic&amp;authPassword=RAW(pa&amp;&amp;word)&amp;authUsername=usr due to: Invalid uri syntax: Double &amp;&amp; marker found. Check the uri and remove the duplicate &amp; marker.
