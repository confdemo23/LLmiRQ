camel-jms - Setting TaskExecutor should support both Spring 2.5 and 3.0
See nabble

We need to use reflection when invoking setTaskExecutor on the spring JMS stuff.
Because at compile time it would be linked to the Spring 3.0 method signature.
And in Spring 2.5 the method signature is different.
Using reflection should allow us to support both cases. And this is only done on startup so no runtime overhead.
