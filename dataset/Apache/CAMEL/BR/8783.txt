Transacted not working correctly in scala
When I try to use transacted in a scala route, I get an error and the camel context doesn&amp;apos;t start.
The error states that there is no output in route.
After some time watching at the code with different breakpoints, I noticed :
In org.apache.camel.scala.dsl.builder.RouteBuilder (l199) the transacted with URI doesn&amp;apos;t call the stack.top.transacted with the URI parameter.
Even with this done, it still gives the same error : 
"Route myRoute has no output processors. You need to add outputs to the route such as to("log:foo")."
even when  my route is as simple as :
"direct:something" ==&gt; 
{

  routeId("log:foo")

  transacted("SomeStrategy")

  --&gt; ("log:foo")

}

After some more debug, I saw that the output list for the transacted node stays empty, so my guess is that, in the org.apache.camel.scala.dsl.SAbstractDefinition class, the line def transacted(ref: String) = wrap(target.transacted(ref)) should return something else to handle outputs.
Since I can mix java and scala routes, there are workarounds, but still, now that I&amp;apos;ve gotten used to scala routes, I don&amp;apos;t really want to go back to java routes
