camel maven run plugin - Auto detect if spring or blueprint
It would be nice if the mvn camel:run plugin could auto detect if your run a spring or blueprint project. Today it defaults to spring because it was the first. For blueprint you need to configure it to be blueprint.
But we can detect the xml if its blueprint or spring in the namespace of the xml.
