Package scanning cannot be used for folders containing special characters
I found out this problem developing a test case with cargo on my macbook. Temporary directory on leopard is something like (/private/var/folders/is/ispMf0ylEtCIOP8skg0va++++TI/Tmp) and cargo deploys the embedded container there.
Problem happens when camel tries to find converters by using DefaultPackageScanClassResolver class; it converts the temporary path, using URLDecoder, in the invalid path "/private/var/folders/is/ispMf0ylEtCIOP8skg0va    TI/Tmp"
You can reproduce this bug by patching the DefaultPackageScanClassResolverTest and adding the following resource file, that I&amp;apos;m going to attach to this issue.
