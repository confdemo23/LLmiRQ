Mail Component: Content-ID reference in multipart broken
It looks like Camel Mail Component does not set Content-ID mime header correctly or probably assumption is that BodyPart will take care of it. As a result embedded images in html body do not work ( img src="cid:somename.img").
Currently Content-ID is set as -
//MailBinding.java
// add a Content-ID header to the attachment
messageBodyPart.addHeader("Content-ID", attachmentFilename.substring(4));
But according to RFC standards http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2392.txt, Content-ID value should be enclosed with in angle brackets, so it should be modified to -
//MailBinding.java
// add a Content-ID header to the attachment
messageBodyPart.addHeader("Content-ID", "&lt;" + attachmentFilename.substring(4) + "&gt;");
Also, below should be modified which incorrectly sets fileName inclusive of "cid:", but expectation would be strip off "cid" off it, similar to Content-ID
// Set the filename
messageBodyPart.setFileName(attachmentFilename);
Should be -
// Set the filename
messageBodyPart.setFileName(attachmentFilename.substring(4));
Also, RFC standard mentions that Content-ID should be globally unique but Camel Mail just sets it to filename instead. I understand this can be problematic as camel will have to replace references to each of such cid&amp;apos;s  in any of the mail parts. 
As I understand from RFC document, is that this is required in case you send emails itself attachments, and attachments can same name can trample each other(I may be wrong here). I guess we can live with this for a while
