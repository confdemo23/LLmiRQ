CXFPayload may lose CDATA sections under stream caching
CAMEL-8410 introduced CachedCXFPayload to add stream-caching support to CXFPayload. This may use during its sequence of conversions the default java.xml.transform.Transformer to convert javax.xml.transform.stax.StAXSource to SAX, which will then drop CDATA sections because its CDATA handling is empty.

To avoid this, CachedCXFPayload can use the conversion utility already included in CXF.
