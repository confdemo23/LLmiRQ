camel-spring-boot - Some routes not being initialized after CamelContext have been removed from CamelAutoConfiguration
In our project we have several classes that extend SpringRouteBuilder and that are annotated with @Component.
Some days ago we&amp;apos;ve noticed that most of them stopped being initialized on application startup.
Found out that our issues started from this commit:
https://github.com/apache/camel/commit/6bcc0b6110a762623888ded294c78dc168a18e75
If I roll it back everything is fine again.
