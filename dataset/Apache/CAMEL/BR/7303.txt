Simple Language - Header access surrounded with quotes
Quotes within header access are not currently handled in the same way as the inbuilt headerAs function or the body accessor notation - perhaps these should be aligned?
For instance with the following route



    &lt;camelContext trace="false" xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint"&gt;

        &lt;route&gt;

            &lt;from uri="direct:entry"/&gt;



            &lt;setHeader headerName="some key"&gt;

                &lt;constant&gt;hello world&lt;/constant&gt;

            &lt;/setHeader&gt;



            &lt;setBody&gt;

                &lt;simple&gt;${headers[&amp;apos;some key&amp;apos;]}&lt;/simple&gt;

            &lt;/setBody&gt;



            &lt;log message="The expression evaluated to :: ${body}" /&gt;



        &lt;/route&gt;

    &lt;/camelContext&gt;



Outcome :

[                          main] route1                         INFO  The expression evaluated to :: 

Expected :

[                          main] route1                         INFO  The expression evaluated to :: hello world

For reference, the current notation works within other parts of the language and are handled as expected

${body[&amp;apos;some key&amp;apos;]}


${headerAs(&amp;apos;some key&amp;apos;, java.lang.Boolean}

I think the fix might be to use StringHelper.removeQuotes on line #269 within SimpleFunctionExpression.java possibly, such as

remainder = StringHelper.removeQuotes(remainder.substring(1, remainder.length() - 1));
