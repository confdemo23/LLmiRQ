CamelContextFactoryBean missing setEndpoints method
The Spring JAXB model class for &lt;camelContext&gt; is missing a setEndpoints() method, which means you cannot add an endpoint outside the route definition using JAXB.  Interestingly, the Blueprint version of CamelContextFactoryBean has this method, so I&amp;apos;m guessing it was just missed.
Impacted classes:
