CamelOverruleFileName does not work correctly for remote file endpoints
According to the docs, when using CamelOverruleFileName, the original CamelFileName should be restored after the overruling name is used once.  This is not working when using a remote file endpoint, such as FTP.
From the description of CAMEL-5269, it seems like this worked once, but it doesn&amp;apos;t seem to anymore.
