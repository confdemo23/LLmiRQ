Amazon SQS message deletion behaviour change on exception
After upgrading applications from Camel 2.15.2 to Camel 2.15.3 we noticed a change in behaviour around the handling of a message from an SQS queue when a processing stage throws an exception.
Previously the message would not be deleted, and would become available to the SQS again.
After the upgrade, messages are deleted even if an exception occurs during the processing stage.
I will attach a unit test which demonstrates the behaviour by:

including a mock process which throws an exception
asserting that there is no call to delete a message.

I believe that the commit which changed the behaviour is:
https://github.com/apache/camel/commit/bd10c49bdcdbe6181e35461c449ea61db9a13bf1
This issue may be specific to the inclusion of a seda stage.
