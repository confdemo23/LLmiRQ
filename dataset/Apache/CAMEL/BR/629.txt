Re-add getContext/setContext to Endpoint as deprecated methods to improve backward compatibilty
In recent refactorings, the getContext()/setContext() methods on Endpoint were renamed to getCamelContext()/setCamelContext().  As discussed recently (http://www.nabble.com/Deprecating-old-methods-and-changing-the-default-error-handler-td17998268s22882.html), it would be better to use deprecation for now and only actually remove the method on our next big release.
