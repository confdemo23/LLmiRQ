Timer - Restarting a timer endpoint may not trigger at expected time the first time
If you stop a timer route, and that route has an inflight exchange causing the stop route to force stop due timeout. Then that timer task is still running in the background.
And if you restart the timer route, then it will reuse the old timer instance, which may be still running, and therefore the first trigger time may not happen at the time you would expect.
For example from timer:foo?period=2s to trigger every 2s.
