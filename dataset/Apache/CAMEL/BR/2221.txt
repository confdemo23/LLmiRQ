Inconsistent out message when using recipient list
When using the Dynamic Recipient List pattern, there&amp;apos;s an inconsistency between two ways of of defining that pattern:

when using a @RecipientList-annotated method with a beanRef, you get the list of endpoints as the out message body
when using the same method with a recipientList(bean(...)) call, you get the aggregated result of the invoked endpoints

I think it would be better if both options returned the same response message and I would suggested the aggregated result of the invoked endpoints is the more appropriate one.
