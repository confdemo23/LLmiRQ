Camel-ftp: No error message on invalid credentials
As result of CAMEL-8718 the connection will be closed on invalid credentials before throwing an exception.
But disconnecting the ftpclient will reset the reply string, so the exception message is null.
The attached patch will store the reply string before disconnecting.
