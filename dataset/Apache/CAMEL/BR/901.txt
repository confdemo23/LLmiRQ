If using thread() processor followed by a pipeline Camel redelivers to the wrong processor
Setup:
Error handler is specified before the thread processor and there are 3 processor after the thread() call. Third processor fails. 
Bug #1:
The exchange received by the failed processor (#3) gets redelivered to the first processor in the pipe.
It should be redeliver to #3 (this works without the thread processor).
Bug #2:
The specified errorHandler (log:testError) receives the exchange that entered processor #1 (first in the pipe).
See details in the attached unit test. Also take a look at the log4j log (copy attached). The 3rd line from the bottom is the log by testError.
