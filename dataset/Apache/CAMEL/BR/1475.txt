Easier transacted configuration of routes
See TransactionalClientWithRollbackTest in camel-spring
The .policy(required) is needed in the routes even though we have a global transaction error handler with a default policy set:

                 errorHandler(transactionErrorHandler(required));


So Camel should fallback and use the global policy if the route itself does not have a policy defined.
