camel-smpp - fails to correctly send messages that require UCS-2 encoding
If I try to send a string without any config options or headers to indicate alphabet/data coding/encoding, it appears to be sent using an 8 bit character set even if a 16 bit UCS-2 encoding is required.
If I try to set CamelSmppAlphabet=-1 (for unknown) as a header, an invalid message is sent to the SMPP peer and it is rejected with SMPP error code 00000401
If I try to set alphabet=-1 in the endpoint config though and if I also set CamelSmppDataCoding=8 then it correctly sends a UCS-2 message.
Looking at the code (particularly the method SmppSmCommand.determineCharset()), it seems that it can ONLY send UCS-2 if alphabet == UNKNOWN_ALPHABET.  Using the value UNKNOWN_ALPHABET (-1) as a header triggers the problem with the SMPP peer so I can only set that value in the endpoint config.  This determineCharset() method should also recognise alphabet == ALPHA_UCS2
