Mina Does Not Unbind From Listening Port
If a bundle includes a mina consumer as the one below, when you stop the bundle, the port is not released. Therefore, when restarting the bundle, you&amp;apos;ll get a port already in use bind exception.



&lt;from uri="mina2:tcp://0.0.0.0:12345?sync=true"/&gt;



Note that the problem does not exist if you&amp;apos;re using an IP address other than 0.0.0.0. For example:



&lt;from uri="mina2:tcp://{{host.name}}:12345?sync=true"/&gt;
