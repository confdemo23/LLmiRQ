NPE in camel-printer when not setting media size or omitting sides attribute
When specifying a camel-printer configuration that does not include config properties for sides or mediaSize, the camel route will fail to start up with a NullPointerException. E.g. this route



from("file://target/incoming?delete=true")

	.to("lpr://localhost/default");



will raise an NPE at route startup time.
