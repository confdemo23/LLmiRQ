Xmpp private chat does not work
This configuration logs in, presence works, but message is not received by the participant.

		from("timer://kickoff?period=10000&amp;delay=1").
		setBody(constant("xmpp message")).
		to("xmpp://xxxxxxxx@gmail.com/?resource=camel-user&amp;password=xxxxxx&amp;participant=xxxxxxxx@jabber.org");


It is cause by the code 

message.setFrom(endpoint.getUser());

1. There is no need to set "from" field: smack will fetch this info from the connection info and will set it up properly.
2. I can&amp;apos;t find the link, but according to common sence and examples in Instant Messaging and Presence  "from" should be JID (Jabber ID) and not just user name!

   &lt;message
       to=&amp;apos;romeo@example.net&amp;apos;
       from=&amp;apos;juliet@example.com/balcony&amp;apos;
       type=&amp;apos;chat&amp;apos;
       xml:lang=&amp;apos;en&amp;apos;&gt;
     &lt;body&gt;Wherefore art thou, Romeo?&lt;/body&gt;
   &lt;/message&gt;
3. "Normal" message is just a hint to UI that the message is not part of conversation but a standalone message. It does not matter practically but ideologically  xmpp component will send messages as they flow and I&amp;apos;d say it is a conversation (or monologue to be precise). So no need to set "Normal" flag either. Smack will set it to the default "chat" type.
