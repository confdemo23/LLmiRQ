JaxbDataFormat should not parse the Schema over and over again
Currently the createMarshaller and createUnmarshaller methods parse the javax.xml.validation.Schema from scratch, which is a severe overhead considering that a Schema instance is threadsafe and it is  encuraged to re-use it as much as possible 
(see http://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/javadocs/api/javax/xml/validation/Schema.html) 
I extended the DataFormat and cached the parsed Schema and did a small benchmark that parsed an input document 64000 times:
JaxbDataFormat: 3:18
AltJaxbDataFormat: 0:35
