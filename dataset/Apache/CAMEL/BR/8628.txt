camel-dozer component fails when multiple expressions are used in a mapping
The reference to the current exchange is cleared on each invocation of ExpressionMapper in the done() method.  If a mapping file contains multiple expression mappings, the first expression clears out the exchange reference and subsequent expression mappings fail with:

java.lang.IllegalStateException: Current exchange has not been set for ExpressionMapper



Fix is to not clear the reference in ExpressionMapper.done().  We should do this in DozerProducer after all mappings in the mapping file have completed.
