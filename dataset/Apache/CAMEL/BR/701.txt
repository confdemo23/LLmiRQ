BeanInvocation - Do not allow Exchange as the return type
Currently if you have a bean invocation configure that is something like this

public Exchange doSomething(Exchange exchange) {
 ..
 return exchange;
}


Then Camel will set the exchange on the exchange out body. This should not be allowed.
Wiki documentation is updated about this, but the code does not check for such condition.
