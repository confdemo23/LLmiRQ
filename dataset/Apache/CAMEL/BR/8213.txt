UseOriginalAggregationStrategy is suspicious to NullPointerException
The default constructor of UseOriginalAggregationStrategy sets the final field original to null.
In one corner case, the aggregate will dereference this null pointer, as no null-pointer check is made.



    public Exchange aggregate(Exchange oldExchange, Exchange newExchange) {

        if (propagateException) {

            Exception exception = checkException(oldExchange, newExchange);

            if (exception != null) {

                original.setException(exception);

            }

        }

        return original != null ? original : oldExchange;

    }



This potential NPE should be fixed, maybe a unit test be added.
