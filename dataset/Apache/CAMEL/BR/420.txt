Problems:

Using ASCII you need to use convertBodyTo(String.class) to let it work out of the box Fixed
Using BINARY we need some Type Converters to let it consume files from a FTP Server and store it as a File Fixed
You have to set the filename using the header in the configuration otherwise the filename can be wrong Fixed
