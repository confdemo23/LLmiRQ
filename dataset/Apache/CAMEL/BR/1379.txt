Mina configuration is shared between endpoints
Establishing a MINA endpoint with a custom codec, and then establishing another without a custom codec is a problem. The second endpoint inherits the first endpoint&amp;apos;s codec.
My recommendation is to not share configuration data between endpoint creation. I recommend that the MINA component instantiate a new configuration for each new endpoint instead of copying the previous configuration.
As a workaround the user can specify "codec" as a URI parameter with no value.
