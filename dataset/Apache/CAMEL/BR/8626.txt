Leaking exchangesInFlightKeys in ManagedRoute
Having a camel context with a single route:



        onException(Throwable.class)

                .handled(true)

                .process(handleException()); // essentially  doing exchange.setException(someConvertedException);



        from("direct:generalFlow")

                .routingSlip(property(GeneralFlowRoute.class.getName()));



started from Spring:



    &lt;camelContext id="flows" xmlns="http://camel.apache.org/schema/spring"&gt;

        &lt;template id="template" defaultEndpoint="direct:generalFlow"/&gt;

        &lt;routeBuilder ref="generalFlow"/&gt;

    &lt;/camelContext&gt;



    &lt;bean id="generalFlow" class="com.blabla.GeneralFlowRoute"/&gt;



During performance test both exchangesInFlightKeys  and exchangesInFlightStartTimestamps are accumulating over time.
But if the test is run in one thread with debug - nothing is accumulated.
Issue found after migration from 2.14.1 to 2.15.1
