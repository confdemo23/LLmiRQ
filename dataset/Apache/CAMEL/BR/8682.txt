Context scoped OnException should not be stopped if a route is stopped
If you stop a route and uses context scoped error handling, then its services may be stopped when the route stops. This should not happen for context scoped as they are reused by other routes etc.
This can also happen for OnCompletion which has same scope as OnException.
