RestBindingMode auto not honored
The usage of rest binding mode is confusing/doesn&amp;apos;t work consistently.
If you look at the field definition:



    @XmlAttribute @Metadata(defaultValue = "auto")

    private RestBindingMode bindingMode;



You would expect that the default value is "auto" but in fact there is no default when running.
You need to explicitly set it in configuration, like this:



restConfiguration()

                .component("jetty")

                .port(9097)

                .bindingMode(RestBindingMode.auto)

        ;
