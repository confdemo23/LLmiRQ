bad content length header value in http response
By default HttpBinding class copies all request header attributes from the request to the response including &amp;apos;Content-Length&amp;apos;. So the consequence is that the response is declaring the same size as the request which can lead to serious truncation problems! 
the workaround is simply to add the line:
out.removeHeader("Content-Length"); 
in the writeResponse method of the httpbinding class allowing jetty to set the right value.
