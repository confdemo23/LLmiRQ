[NettyHttp] Remove headerFilterStrategy option after resolving
In Camel Netty HTTP component, we don&amp;apos;t remove headerFilterStrategy option from the parameters, so it is propagated as a query parameter.
When I create producer URL like this - netty-http:http://host.com?headerFilterStrategy=#headerFilterStrategy&amp;foo=bar I expect only foo=bar to be send as a query to to endpoint (while headerFilterStrategy=#headerFilterStrategy should be resolved from the registry and removed from the parameters). This is how it works in Jetty component for example.
