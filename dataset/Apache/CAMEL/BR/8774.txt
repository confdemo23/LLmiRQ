DefaultJettyHttpBinding preserves CONTEXT_ENCODING from the request even HTTP response doesn&apos;t contain the header
When Http Request is Gzip encoded (CONTENT_ENCODING is set) but the HTTP response is not ( httpExchange.getResponseHeaders().get(HttpHeaders.CONTENT_ENCODING) == null) then Exchange.CONTENT_ENCODING is present in the Camel out message.
This is because DefaultJettyHttpBinding:125 preserves all in headers.
I believe that HTTP protocol headers (except custom ones) from the in shouldn&amp;apos;t be copied to the Camel out message.
