Enricher - AggregationStrategy - Problem with preparing logic
The ExchangeHelper.prepareAggregation method moves the message to IN to avoid confusing end users whether what they are looking for is on either IN or OUT.
Hover we some recent changes in MessageSupport to clear some headers it could cause problems as it was in fact the same message being copied from OUT to IN.
What it should do instead is to move it instead of using copy mechanism.
