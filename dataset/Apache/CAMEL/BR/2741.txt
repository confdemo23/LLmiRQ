GZIP/ZIP marshal/unmarshal leaves input file open
Gzip/zip marshal/unmarshal leaves input files open, relying on the garbage collector to close the file. The cause sporadic file deletion exceptions in the following route:
          from("file:incoming?delete=true")
            .marshal().gzip()
            .to("file:outgoing?fileName=$
{file:name}
.gz");
