CxfEndpointBeanDefinitionParser throws a ClassCastException when definining inner list elements in spring configuration
In the CxfEndpointBeanDefinitionParser, the list elements being read are cast to com.sun.xml.bind.v2.schemagen.xmlschema.List class which is never true...
Why don&amp;apos;t we just leave it as a object or atleast cast it to a java.util.List?
For getting the error just add the following configuration to a cxf endpoint:
  &lt;cxf:cxfEndpoint id="toEndpoint1" 
                   address="http://localhost:9091/GreeterContext/GreeterPort" 
                   serviceClass="demo.router.Greeter"&gt;
      &lt;cxf:features&gt;
          &lt;cxfcore:logging/&gt;
      &lt;/cxf:features&gt;
  &lt;/cxf:cxfEndpoint&gt;
cxfcore points to the "http://cxf.apache.org/core" namespace.
I have attached a patch for this problem &amp; would appreciate if someone applied it.
Thanks
