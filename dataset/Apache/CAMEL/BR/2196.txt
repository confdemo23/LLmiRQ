camel-cxf - CxfProducer in POJO mode should be able to use POJO object directly without wrapped as List
See camel-example-cxf-async
In the client code that sends to the server using CxfProducer. I have to wrap my POJO in a List object.
CxfProducer should be smarter and be able to do this itself.
It can do this by converting the payload to an iterator and use that to construct the list.
Then it works for POJO objects directly.
