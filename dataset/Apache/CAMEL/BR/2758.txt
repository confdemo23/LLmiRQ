OnCompletion - Should use pipes and filters to ensure IN is OUT from last step
OnCompletion will route the Exchange directly as is which means if you have set an OUT the first step in the onCompletion route may not use this OUT but the IN instead.
And also add option useOriginalBody so you can do work based on the original input instead.
