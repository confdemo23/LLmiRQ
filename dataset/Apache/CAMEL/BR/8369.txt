weaveAddLast does not work property when route ends with a split
When using AdviceWithRouteBuilder to modify a route definition, weaveAddLast does not work correctly when the route ends with a split.  It appears to add the additional components within the split, not afterwards.
See attached testcase.
Adding a trivial operation after the split in the original route builder fixes it.
