EXCEPTION_CAUGHT header should be set to exception caught
Currently whatever exception is caught in doCatch there is a EXCEPTION_CAUGHT header set to the exception that was set on the exchange itself. As doCatch() traverses causes of exception it might happen that something else is caught and something else is in EXCEPTION_CAUGHT header.
