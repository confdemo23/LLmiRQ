CamelContexts seems to not correctly create their own instance of an imported routeContext.
Issue: http://old.nabble.com/Direct-route-not-shared-across-contexts--td28766143.html
When two CamelContexts import the same routeContext they should instantiate their own route based on the definition in the routeContext. But something is not working correctly. One example is having a directqueue of the same name in each route-instance. Camel crashed with the exception:
org.apache.camel.RuntimeCamelException: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Endpoint direct://foo only allows 1 active consumer but you attempted to start a 2nd consumer.
	at org.apache.camel.util.ObjectHelper.wrapRuntimeCamelException(ObjectHelper.java:1126)
	at org.apache.camel.spring.SpringCamelContext.onApplicationEvent(SpringCamelContext.java:103) ...
This is demonstrated in the sample file attached to this issue.
Obviously this makes other things than the direct-endpoints malfunction. But this should be enough to show the problem.
