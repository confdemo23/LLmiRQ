Mail component sends to the wrong address
The camel mail page states that the issues with the Mail Component are related to geronimo.  However there is a fundamental problem when you have more than 1 endpoint defined.  We define multiple endpoints so we can place different To addresses
        &lt;endpoint id="oneEmail" uri="smtp://MAILSERVER?To=$
{one.email}
&amp;From=blah@blah.com" /&gt;
        &lt;endpoint id="twoEmail" uri="smtp://MAILSERVER?To=$
{two.email}
&amp;From=blah@blah.com" /&gt;
        &lt;endpoint id="errorEmail" uri="smtp://MAILSERVER?To=$
{error.email}
&amp;From=blah@blah.com" /&gt;
            &lt;to uri="bean:errorFormatter?method=formatErrorEmail" /&gt;
            &lt;to ref="errorEmail" /&gt;
It is not possible to configure the uri in &lt;to /&gt; since it does not support spring properties.  
The bug is that MailConfiguration.copy() does not create a new Map for recipients, so when the second endpoint is created it overwrites the first. there are other fields that may be affected e.g. javaMailProperties, additionalJavaMailProperties, javaMailSender

If you have trouble with sending mails that, for instance, don&amp;apos;t contain any subject, have wrong recipients, or manifest other unforeseen errors, it could be due to having geronimo-javamail_1.4_spec-1.3.jar in your classpath. This was the culprit in a long bug hunt reported in CAMEL-869.
This should be changed as wrong recipients are more likely related to camel bugs, than geronimo issues.
