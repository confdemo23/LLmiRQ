UnitOfWork.getOriginalInMessage does not restore headers
I noticed the map of headers is not restored to its original state when restoring the original message. I can&amp;apos;t imagine this is by design...
Debugging shows the same instance of Map is being used so the "original" message is actually being mutated during the route execution.



exchange.getIn().getHeaders() == exchange.getUnitOfWork().getOriginalInMessage().getHeaders();



Looking into the code of DefaultUnitOfWork it is of note that the incoming message is a JMSMessage (specifically a TibjmsTextMessage)
