Oracle AQ contains a typo "JMSXRecvTimeStamp" -- the JMS spec lists  the correct spelling as "JMSXRcvTimeStamp". Camel&apos;s JmsBinding also has the correct spelling, but can be patched to prevent Oracle AQ from puking.

Oracle&amp;apos;s Message implementation (AQjmsMessage) has a typo, I am pretty certain that it exists as "JMSXRecvTimeStamp". To workaround this typo I patched org.apache.camel.component.jms.JMSBinding to include the misspelled property name in set of ignored headers/properties.
Additionally, I believe Oracle might be setting null values for empty or missing standard and optional JMS reserved properties/headers. Most notably JMSReplyTo. This is resulting in JMSBinding attempting to set a null Destination on the JMSReplyTo header which then results in an Oracle exception. A quick patch was to check for null values and ignore them in the method JmsBinding.appendJmsProperties() for the JMSReplyTo header. A better fix is probably to prevent empty/blank headers or properties from originating at the Oracle level... assuming nulls/blanks are not allowed by the JMS 1.1 spec.
Anyhoo, I will attach some diff patches to this issue for your review. 
Cheers!
