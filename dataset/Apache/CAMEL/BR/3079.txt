job rescheduling and clustering does not work properly 
Currently stateful cron jobs are identified by their group name, job name and the cron expression. This prevents an easy rescheduling of cron jobs. For instance, stopping a camel context, rescheduling the cron job by editing the cron expressing and restart will end up in an exception. This will happen because the rescheduled job will be added as an additional job. The already existing job will produce an exception because the corresponding endpoint doesn&amp;apos;t exist anymore. The previous solution deleting all triggers on shutdown doesn&amp;apos;t work in a cluster scenario. 
I suggest to identify cron jobs only by their group and job name. On startup it will check if a trigger already exists and check if the cron expression has changed. If so it will be rescheduled.
Also the current explicit resuming of stateful jobs will produce an exception during startup, because the scheduler automatically finds and resumes stored triggers.
