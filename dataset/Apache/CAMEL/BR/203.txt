FileComponent sometimes creates file instead of directory
When using the FileComponent ("file://") to publish to a non-existent directory tree, the last part of the path is created as file instead of directory. It only happens when setting the filename in the header (FileComponent.HEADER_FILE_NAME).
This is because the method that determines the file name (which checks whether a directory exists), is called before the directory tree is built.
