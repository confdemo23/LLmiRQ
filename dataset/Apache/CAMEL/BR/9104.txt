HttpHelper concats fixed endpoint URI query parameters with CamelHttpPath header in wrong order



.setHeader(Exchange.HTTP_PATH, constant("/my/path"))

.to("http4://myhost:80?abc=123")



leads to Camel requesting the following URL:



http://myhost:80?abc=123/my/path



instead of:



http://myhost:80/my/path?abc=123
