BeanShell Expressions Don&apos;t Work
BeanShell 2.0b5 has the JSR-223 integration, but it implements Compilable, when in fact it throws an exception if you call compile.
Camel calls compile for any language that implements Compilable, therefore you get an exception every time your route has BeanShell in it.
I notice the BeanShell tests are commented-out in camel-script.
Also, the Camel Wiki page for BeanShell is stupendously vague on actual usage.
