NullPointerException on BindyFixedLengthFactory.unbind()
The Camel Bindy component throws a NullPointerException on unbind when you&amp;apos;ve specified a header, but no footer. It looks like there was a simple copy/paste error in the marshal method. When generating the models, it checks the headerRow for null and then adds the headerRow. It then checks the headerRow (not the footerRow) for null and then adds the footerRow. Later down the chain, the BindyFixedLengthFactory throws a null exception when it tries to call getName() on the model Class.
