Path gets decoded when bridging HTTP endpoints
When bridging HTTP endpoints like this, the HTTP path gets decoded at the TO endpoint:



from("netty-http:http://localhost:9000/camel?matchOnUriPrefix=true")

        .to("http4://host1:9000/fred?bridgeEndpoint=true");



For instance, requesting to http://localhost:9000/camel/%3B will result in a call to http://host1:9000/fred/;, thus cause several issues downstream.
