ExchangeBuilder to create messages using fluent builder style
So you from the Java API using a fluent builder style, can create an Exchange to send, for example with the ProducerTemplate.
Currently you can use a inlined Processor to do that but its a bit ugly and verbose.

Exchange exchange = ExchangeBuilder("activemq:queue:foo").withBody("Hello World").andHeader("JMSReplyTo", "bar").andHeader("foo", 123).create();
template.send(exchange);


The trick is the Exchange has to be created by the producer and hence we need to know the endpoint uri where to send it.
