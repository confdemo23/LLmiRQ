camel-rabbitmq logging exceptions as debug
Connecting to RabbitMQ using camel-rabbitmq I&amp;apos;ve noticed that no ERROR is logged if the component cannot connect, the exceptions are handled and logged as DEBUG. 
This is a bit inconvenient as logging all DEBUG messages for the component fills up our logs, in production we usually set INFO as threshold.
