PGPDataFormat: Sub-Key not supported for signing and correct selection of encryption/signing key via KeyFlag
A PGP key ring with version 4 keys typically consists of a primary key which has sub-keys. There is a use-case where the primary key has only the usage flag (KeyFlag) "certify" and one sub-key is makred with the usage flag "signing" and the other sub-key is marked with usage flag"encryption".  In this case the PGPDataFormat does not use the correct sub-key for signing and encryption.
In the patch I enabled the usage of sub-keys for the signing process and I introduced the usage flag (KeyFlag) for finding the correct keys for signing and encryption.
