Salesforce component security listener does not replace old auth header
The security listener incorrectly adds a copy of the auth header for streaming api client. Although this causes the exchange to ultimately fail, the BayeuxClient reconnects and proceeds without raising errors in Camel route. However, this ends up logging multiple warnings from the security listener and the BayeuxClient. 
Fixing the security listener to reset the auth header will optimize this process and let the BayeuxClient continue with the existing exchange.
