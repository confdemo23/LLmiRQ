Quartz routes are not started if quartz component is referenced after context was started
Quartz routes are not active if added after camel context was already started.
Here is an elaborate description of the problem and a sample project that reproduces it: http://anydoby.com/jblog/en/java/1955
Sorry, no patch this time because I may not know enough about the internals of QuartzComponent, hesitate to offer anything but a boolean flag somewhere.
