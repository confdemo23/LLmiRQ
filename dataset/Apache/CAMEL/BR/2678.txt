Removing entries from FileIdempotentRepository don&apos;t get persisted
Removing an entry (file name) programatically from a file idempotent repository has only effect on the cache and does not get persisted on the file repository. 
There are some situations in which one may need to rerun a file through a workflow and it makes neccessary to remove the file from the idempotent repository. A specific problem arises when upon a server restart, the file is not picked up by the workflow because the remove was not persisted/spooled on the disk.
