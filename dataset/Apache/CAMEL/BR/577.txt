ResolverUtil can&apos;t resolve class under osgi enviroment
in method of 
protected void find(Test test, String packageName, ClassLoader loader) 
it try to load class  from directory or jar, it works for standalone mode.
But if the classloader of the method is osgi bundle class loader, it will fail since the getResource(packgename) return neither directory nor jar
for example, package name is org/apache/camel/convert, then what returned is /org/apache/camel/convert, so both loadImplementationsInDirectory and loadImplementationsInJar doesn&amp;apos;t work in this case
