BindingOperationInfos that are stored in exchange are inconsistent between CxfProducer and CxfConsumer
CxfProducer could store a unwrapped version of the BindingOperationInfo in the exchange which is inconsistent with CxfConsumer and it puts burden on the application to revert back to the wrapped version.  CxfProducer should store the original version before calling.

                boi = boi.getUnwrappedOperation();
