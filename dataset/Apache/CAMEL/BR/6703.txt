camel-mail - Folder is not open
I think I&amp;apos;ve found a bug in camel-mail source (MailConsumer.java)
If you define a mail endpoint which has closeFolder option to true you may encounter a folder is not open exception.
In fact, the delete action occured during processBatch which is set as an exchange&amp;apos;s onCompletion. OnCompletion is executed in a new thread and right after that, we have the finally of the try-catch clause which is executed in a concurrent thread.
Therefore, we can then have a folder that is open at the beginning of the processCommit but becoming closed during the search for an email with the uid because the finally is executed.
Am I wrong or is it a real bug?
I&amp;apos;ve attached MailConsumer.java that should fix this bug.
Cheers!
