Incorrect behavior of intercept() if more than one route configured
With the RouteBuilder defining more than one route, the intercept() will actually have one instance of the interceptor shared among routes which causes the odd behavior of proceeding to a destination in all routes.  For instance in the example below, sending a message to "direct:foo" will cause both "mock:one" and "mock:two" to receive a message.

    protected RouteBuilder createRouteBuilder() throws Exception {
        return new RouteBuilder() {
            public void configure() throws Exception {
                intercept().to("log:foo").proceed();

                from("direct:foo").to("mock:one");
                from("direct:bar").to("mock:two");
            }
        };
    }
