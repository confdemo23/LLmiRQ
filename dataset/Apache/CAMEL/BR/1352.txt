HttpHeaderFilterStrategy tries to filter out "http.requestMethod" but doesn&apos;t
I actually found this in 1.5.0, but a quick look in ViewVC indicates that it still happens in 1.6.0 and in the trunk.
HttpHeaderFilterStrategy uses String.toLowerCase on "http.responseCode" because of the capital C.
It should also use toLowerCase on "http.requestMethod" because of the capital M, but it doesn&amp;apos;t.
Thus the http.requestMethod header leaks into the HTTP protocol headers.
