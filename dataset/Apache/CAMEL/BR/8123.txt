Mina2 SSL initiates handshake backwards
The Mina2Consumer and Mina2Producer are configured backwards for SSL handshake initiation. The consumer is trying to initiate the handshake rather than the producer. You can see this by setting up a SSL enabled consuming route and telnet to the port, you will immediately get some data sent from the server to the client rather than the server waiting on the client to initiate the handshake.
The issue is Mina2Consumer:160, it is setting UseClientMode to true, it should be false. Mina2Producer line 313 needs to also change to the following:
            SslFilter filter = new SslFilter(configuration.getSslContextParameters().createSSLContext(), configuration.isAutoStartTls());
filter.setUseClientMode(true);
connector.getFilterChain().addFirst("sslFilter", filter);
As far as I can tell this has been a bug since this component was introduced.
