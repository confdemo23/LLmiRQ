recipientList onException redelivery issue
using a recipientList containing a csv list of ftp endpoints.
I would like to retry the delivery to a given ftp enpoint fails. 
I&amp;apos;ve set up an onException with maximumRedeliveries set to 2. 
In case an error occurs sending the message to 1 ftp endpoint the redelivery is performed on all endpoints specified on the csv list; the redelivery should be performed only on the failed endpoint is there a way to achieve this?
route sample 
from("direct:delivery.notification.test")
.onException(Exception.class).maximumRedeliveries(2).redeliverDelay(60L).handled(true).end()
.recipientList(header("recipientListHeader").tokenize(","))
.parallelProcessing().executorService(customThreadPoolExecutor)
						//.aggregationStrategy(new recipientAggregationStrategy())
						.to("direct:chunk.completed");
