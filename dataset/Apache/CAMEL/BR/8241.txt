Exec command failures using Java 8 on Unix
I&amp;apos;m attaching a test case that shows an issue I&amp;apos;ve been running into with the exec command since updating my environment to Java 8. It appears that I&amp;apos;m running into a race condition where a stream is sometimes closed prematurely before DefaultExecutor has a chance to close it, causing DefaultExecCommandExecutor to throw and exit (even though the command did execute properly). I&amp;apos;ve tested this against the updated version of commons-exec as well just to make sure this hasn&amp;apos;t somehow been fixed in that library.
Please note that the attached test doesn&amp;apos;t always fail; you may need to run it a few times before the error will show up.
