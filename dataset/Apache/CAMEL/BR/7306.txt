Camel:Kafka NPE when trying to consume messages from kafka server
I&amp;apos;ve installed and configured zookeeper and kafka servers using apache quick start guide on ubuntu running in vmware.
Launch producer for already created topic "page_visits" and try to consume messages and nothing happens.
Trying to debug KafkaEndpoint i can see that server doesn&amp;apos;t send me any key (KafkaConstants.KEY) so here:
message.setHeader(KafkaConstants.KEY, new String(mm.key()));
 i got NPE and it silently fails.
