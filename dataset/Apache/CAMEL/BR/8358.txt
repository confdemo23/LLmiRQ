Avoid using Olingo2 library classes from &apos;core&apos; package as it has been designated internal and not part of the API exposed using OSGi headers
Olingo2 library classes in &amp;apos;core&amp;apos; are internal and should not be used. Even though the URI parser classes should really have been exposed through the public API. This includes a public URI parser URIInfo exposed through the api package, but its implementation URIInfoImpl is part of core and hence not exposed. 
This does not affect any public component classes in the Olingo2 component.
