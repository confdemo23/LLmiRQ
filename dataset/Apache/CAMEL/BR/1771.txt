ProducerCache should be limited to not eat memory (was: recipientList leaks memory)
I found that RecipientList leaks memory .
The problem is that RecipientList stores endpoints in producerCache and cache key computed by using getEndpointUri. If endpoint uris are unique ( as we have ) then every new entry will stored in cache and will never released.
In example we are using recipientList  to send messages to the external http server, every url contains unique query parameters therefor every recipientList entry will create new producer ant that producer will stored in producerCache.
In our system recipientList wlil leak about 20M per day
Unfortunately I was unable to find any workaround
