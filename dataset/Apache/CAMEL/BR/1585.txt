SFTP GenericFileProducer.createFileName produces OS normalized file name, that doesn&apos;t work with SFTP
The use of File.separator and FileUtil.normalizePath in GenericFileProducer.createFileName produce a OS normalized file name, that doesn&amp;apos;t work with SFTP
e.g. outboundout_20090501_091940_ACC.txt which will not work produce a file called outboundout_20090501_091940_ACC.txt
The proper name should be outbound/out_20090501_091940_ACC.txt
