DumpRouteStatsAsXml do not work when jmx domain is customized
According to the documentation (Here) we can customize the jmx domain name.
When the domain name is different from org.apache.camel all the dumpRouteStatsAsXml are empty and does not work anymore.
After some investigation it is because the MBean operation does not take into account the runtime domain name and only use "org.apache.camel" (here) 
I&amp;apos;ve done a unit test to reproduce and tried to do a fix,
