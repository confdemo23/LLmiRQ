camel-bean - Should throw NoTypeConversionAvailableException if body cannot be converted to parameter type
If you route a message to a bean which has for example a org.w3c.Document as parameter type for the body, then Camel should thrown an conversion exception in case the payload cannot be converted to that type. And on the same time if the payload is really null then Camel should of course pass in null.
