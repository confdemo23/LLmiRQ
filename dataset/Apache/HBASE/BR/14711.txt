Remove or annotated deprecated methods in HRegionInfo
Several methods were deprecated in 1.0 and moved to MetaTableAccessor.  This removes them from the 2.0 branch and converts them to the MetaTableAccessor.
HRegionInfo#getComparator  was marked deprecated after 1.0 so needs to remain. (HBASE-13501)
