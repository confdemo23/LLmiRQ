filters are not working correctly
Filters used in Scanning the table are not working correctly. For example a table with three rows:
1. rowkey = adminbackslash-nb0, desc:temp = "temp"
2. rowkey = adminbackslash-nb1, desc:temp = "temp"
3. rowkey = adminkleptoman, desc:temp = "temp"
If I scan all rows in the table without filter I get all the rows as expected. But applying a simple prefixfilter with parameter "adminbackslash" will return only first row. I searched it down to HRegion::nextInternal method, which will not output one passed row before denied row(by filter).
