Canary in regionserver mode might not enumerate all regionservers
When running in regionserver mode the Canary is expected to probe for service health one time per regionserver during a probe interval. 
Each time the canary chore fires, we create a RegionServerMonitor, which uses filterRegionServerByName (via getAllRegionServerByName) to enumerate over all table descriptors, find the locations for each table, then assemble the list of regionservers to probe from this result. The list may not contain all live regionservers, if there is a regionserver up but for some reason not serving any regions. To ensure we have the complete list of live regionservers I think it would be better to use Admin#getClusterStatus and enumerate the live server list returned in the result.
