There are a large number of Java warnings in HBase
There are a large number of Java warnings in the current HBase code base including:

exceptions that do not define serialVersionUID
classes that use the raw type WritableComparable instead of WritableComparable&lt;T&gt;
classes or interfaces that declare public members that are not a part of the public API. In this case they should be moved to a place where their visibility needs not be public. Additionally, there are a number of classes that declare public members that need not be. Make them protected or private or default as needed
methods that have unnecessary else clauses
potential null pointer access
inner classes that are public that should be default or protected (e.g. RegionHistoryInformation)
assignment to an input parameter
