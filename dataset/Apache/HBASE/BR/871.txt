Major compaction periodicity should be specifyable at the column family level, not cluster wide
jon gray has a table of ten rows and a couple of columns that is constantly being updated.  Has max versions of 2.  This table is growing fast because all versions written are kept until a major compaction.  The way this table is being used is different than that of others.  Would be good if he could have major compactions run more often than the default once a day.
