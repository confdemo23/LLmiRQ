RpcClientImpl#tracedWriteRequest incorrectly closes HTrace span
In this method we continue the span and then close it, which causes the current span (the one created by client app around HTabl#get() or similar API call) to be closed incorrectly.



 TraceScope ts = Trace.continueSpan(span);

      try {

        writeRequest(call, priority, span);

      } finally {

        ts.close();

      }
