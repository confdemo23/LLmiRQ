HBASE_ZNODE_FILE on master server is overwritten by regionserver process in case of master-rs collocation 
In case of master-rs collocation HBASE_ZNODE_FILE is overwritten by regionserver process in HRegionServer#handleReportForDutyResponse() here is how it looks on master server:



[hbase@hnode2 hbase]$ cat hbase-hbase-master.znode 

/hbase/rs/hnode2,16000,1448022074888



it contains regionserver znode path instead of String value of master&amp;apos;s ServerName.  This affects ZNodeClearer#clear() in way that will not clear master znode in case we detect master crash. At end this will extend  failover time until master znode expires configured in zookeeper by maxSessionTimeout parameter (40s in my case).
I have notice this on mater branch but it can be case in other branches where we are collocating master and rs.
