HTable Mismatch between javadoc and what it actually does
The code is:
  /** 

Delete all cells that match the passed row and column and whose
timestamp is equal-to or older than the passed timestamp, using an
existing row lock.
@param row Row to update
@param column name of column whose value is to be deleted
@param ts Delete all cells of the same timestamp or older.
@param rl Existing row lock
@throws IOException
@deprecated As of hbase 0.20.0, replaced by 
{@link #delete(Delete)}
   */
  public void deleteAll(final byte [] row, final byte [] column, final long ts,
      final RowLock rl)
  throws IOException 
{

    Delete d = new Delete(row, ts, rl);

    d.deleteColumn(column);

    delete(d);

  }

The code should call deleteColumns() instead.
