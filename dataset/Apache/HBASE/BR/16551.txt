Cleanup SplitLogManager and CatalogJanitor
couple of cleanups around SplitLogManager and CatalogJanitor:
replace all copy-pasted cast in SplitLogManager with one call to an helper method
remove Server, MasterServices, Stoppable since we call the class in only one place and is called as master, master, master
reuse MockNoopMasterServices instead of creating the Server/MasterServices classes
