ZooKeeper znode ACL checks should only compare the shortname
After HBASE-13768 we check at startup in secure configurations if our znodes have the correct ACLs. However when checking the ACL we compare the Kerberos fullname, which includes the host component. We should only compare the shortname, the principal. Otherwise in a multimaster configuration we will unnecessarily reset ACLs whenever any master running on a host other than the one that initialized the ACLs makes the check. You can imagine this happening multiple times in a rolling restart scenario.
