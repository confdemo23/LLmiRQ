table &apos;does not exist&apos; when it does
This one I&amp;apos;ve seen a few times.  In hql, I do show tables and it shows my table.  I then try to do a select against the table and hql reports table does not exist.  Digging, whats happening is that the getClosest facility is failing to find the first table region in the .META. table.  I hacked up a region reading tool  attached (for 0.1 branch)  and tried it against but a copy and the actual instance of the region and it could do the getClosest fine.  I&amp;apos;m pretty sure I restarted the HRS and when it came up again, the master had given it again the .META. and again was failing to find the first region in the table (Looked around in server logs and it seemed &amp;apos;healthy&amp;apos;).
