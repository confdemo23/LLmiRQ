TableCFsUpdater maybe failed due to no write permission on peerNode
After HBASE-11393, replication table-cfs use a PB object. So it need copy the old string config to new PB object when upgrade cluster. In our use case, we have different kerberos for different cluster, etc. online serve cluster and offline processing cluster. And we use a unify global admin kerberos for all clusters. The peer node is created by client. So only global admin has the write  permission for it. When upgrade cluster, HMaster doesn&amp;apos;t has the write permission on peer node, it maybe failed to copy old table-cfs string to new PB Object. I thought it need a tool for client to do this copy job.
