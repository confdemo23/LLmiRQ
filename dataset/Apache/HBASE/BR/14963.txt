Remove use of Guava Stopwatch from HBase client code
We ran into an issue where an application bundled its own Guava (and that happened to be in the classpath first) and HBase&amp;apos;s MetaTableLocator threw an exception due to the fact that Stopwatch&amp;apos;s constructor wasn&amp;apos;t compatible... Might be better to not depend on Stopwatch at all in MetaTableLocator since the functionality is easily doable without.
