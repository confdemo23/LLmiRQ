Create bulk load replication znode(hfile-refs) in ZK replication queue by default
Create bulk load replication znode(hfile-refs) in ZK replication queue by default same as hbase replication znode. 
Otherwise the problem what happens is currently replication admin directly operates on ZK without routing through HM/RS. So suppose if a user enables the replication for bulk loaded data in server but fails to do the same in the client configurations then add peer will not add hfile-refs znode, resulting in replication failure for bulk loaded data.
So after fixing this the behavior will be same as mutation replication.
