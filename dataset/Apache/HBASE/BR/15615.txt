Wrong sleep time when RegionServerCallable need retry
In RpcRetryingCallerImpl, it get pause time by expectedSleep = callable.sleep(pause, tries + 1); And in RegionServerCallable, it get pasue time by sleep = ConnectionUtils.getPauseTime(pause, tries + 1). So tries will be bumped up twice. And the pasue time is 3 * hbase.client.pause when tries is 0.
RETRY_BACKOFF = 
{1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 40, 100, 100, 100, 100, 200, 200}
