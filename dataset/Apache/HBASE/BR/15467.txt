Remove 1.x/2.0 TableDescriptor incompatibility
I&amp;apos;m experimenting with Master on "2.0" and RSs on 1.x and the first problem that I get is on createTable where the Master is trying to write the HTD as TableDescriptor instead of TableSchema and the RS is not able to read it.
Since TableDescriptor does nothing for now. I&amp;apos;d say we can remove it.
