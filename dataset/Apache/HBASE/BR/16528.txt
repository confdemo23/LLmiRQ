Procedure-V2: ServerCrashProcedure misses owner information
ServerCrashProcedure constructor does not set up owner information.  If someone wants to access the owner of ServerCrashProcedure, it would get NPE (eg. in case someone accidentally tries to abort a ServerCrashProcedure, the coprocessor to check owner of the procedure would throw NPE)
