ReadOnly transactions generate WAL activity.
Currently we write a start entry in the WAL each time a transaction starts, and a commit/abort at the end of the transaction. This means read-only transactions unnecessarily generate two WAL entries per region.
Can avoid this by removing the start entry from the WAL (this is implicit in the first trx OP entry we see), and only writing commit/abort when the transaction has a write.
