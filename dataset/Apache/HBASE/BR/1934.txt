NullPointerException in ClientScanner
The following stack trace was observed whilst loading a large volume of data into Hbase:
Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException
 at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.HTable$ClientScanner.next(HTable.java:2008)
 at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.HTable$ClientScanner$1.hasNext(HTable.java:2089)
It appears that lastResult is initialized to be null, however in the exception handling code there isn&amp;apos;t any null checking before the field is accessed for get row:
            this.scan.setStartRow(this.lastResult.getRow());
There should be some additional null checking logic here.
