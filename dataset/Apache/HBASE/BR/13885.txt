ZK watches leaks during snapshots
When taking snapshot of a table a watcher over /hbase/online-snapshot/abort/snapshot-name is created which is never cleared when the snapshot is successful. If we use snapshots to take backups daily we accumulate a lot of watches.
Steps to reproduce -
1) Take snapshot of a table - snapshot &amp;apos;table_1&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;abc&amp;apos;
2) Run the following on zk node or alternatively observe zk watches metric
 echo "wchc" | nc localhost 2181
/hbase/online-snapshot/abort/abc can be found.
