Prefix_Tree seekBefore() does not work correctly
This is related to the TestSeekTo test case where the seekBefore() does not work with Prefix_Tree because of an issue in getFirstKeyInBlock(). In the trunk and branch-1 changing the return type of getFirstKeyInBlock() from BB to Cell resolved the problem, but the same cannot be done in 0.98. Hence we need a change in the KvUtil.copyToNewBuffer API to handle this.  Since the limit is made as the position - in seekBefore when we do 



byte[] firstKeyInCurrentBlock = Bytes.getBytes(firstKey);



in HFileReaderV2.seekBefore() we end up in an empty byte array and it would not be the expected one based on which we try to seek to load a new block.
