Adding a flush file of zero entries
Saw this in log in TRUNK:

    [junit] 2008-04-04 20:22:40,943 DEBUG [RegionServer:0.cacheFlusher] regionserver.HStore(676): Added 1403560700/text/8075392345773720818 with 0 entries, sequence id 537, data size 0.0, file size 110.0 for 1403560700/text


I thought that we&amp;apos;d fixed flushing zero-entry files
