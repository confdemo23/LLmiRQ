TestReplicationAdmin should clean up MiniZKCluster resource
org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.replication.TestReplicationAdmin Unit test has a @BeforeClass component to start MiniZKCluster, but it does not have a @AfterClass component to shut down MiniZKCluster and clean up the resources from MiniZKCluster.  In Jenkins machine that continuously run tests, the resource leak could affect other tests. 
The solution is trivial.
