change how we build/configure lzocodec
i got a reply to my proposed patch for lzocodec:
Instead of deriving from DefaultCodec, you probably want to do the followng:
CompressionCodec lzoCodec = (CompressionCodec)
ReflectionUtils.newInstance(Class.forName("com.hadoop.compression.lzo.LzoCodec"), conf);
setConf is automatically handled by RefletionUtils.newInstance.
We should do that.
