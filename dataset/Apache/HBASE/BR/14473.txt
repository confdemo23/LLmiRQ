Compute region locality in parallel
Right now on large clusters it&amp;apos;s necessary to turn off the locality balance cost as it takes too long to compute the region locality. This is because it&amp;apos;s computed when need in serial.
We should compute this in parallel before it&amp;apos;s needed.
