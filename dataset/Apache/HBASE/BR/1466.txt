Binary keys are not first class citizens
If you use binary keys, you don&amp;apos;t get full features as if you were not using binary keys.  Some things that are broken:

grep/less cant search in logfiles with binary data
displays are unreadable due to weird utf8/other issues
can&amp;apos;t use the region historian
etc
