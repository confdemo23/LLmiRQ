Table mutation operations should check table level rights, not global rights 
drop/modify/disable/enable etc table operations should not check for global CREATE/ADMIN rights, but table CREATE/ADMIN rights. Since we check for global permissions first for table permissions, configuring table access using global permissions will continue to work.
