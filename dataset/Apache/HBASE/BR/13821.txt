WARN if hbase.bucketcache.percentage.in.combinedcache is set
HBASE-11520 improved configuration of bucket cache to no longer require hbase.bucketcache.percentage.in.combinedcache. This was done rather aggressively, with this previously mandatory configuration being ignored. This can result in RS crashes for unsuspecting users. We should add a WARN when hbase.bucketcache.percentage.in.combinedcache is set to make debugging the crash more straight forward.
