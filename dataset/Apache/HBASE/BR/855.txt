compaction can return less versions then we should in some cases
say we have a column with max version = 3 and we have 3 records  
we insert a new record with a old timestamp.
What happeds in the compaction is the the new record with the old timestamp get read first and could push out some of our 
versions if the new record(s) with the old timestamp has a expired ttl.
This happens because we track the total times we see a row/column but do not reduce this count if the cell is expired
and sense we pass the cell in order of the newest HStoreFile first with the newest records passed might not be the newest timestamps.
Got to wait for HBASE-834 to be committed then I can add a patch for this bug. will be a simple fix.
