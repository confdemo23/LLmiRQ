HLog recovery is not performed after master failure
I have a local cluster running, and its logging to
&lt;hbase&gt;/log_X.X.X.X_1213228101021_60020/
Then I kill both master and regionserver, and restart. Looking through
the logs I don&amp;apos;t see anything about trying to recover from this hlog,
it just creates a new hlog alongside the existing one (with a new
startcode).  The older hlog seems to be ignored, and the tables
created in the inital session are all gone.
