Improve the AssignmentManager#updateTimer and speed up handling opened event
We found handing opened event very slow in the environment with lots of regions.
The problem is the slow AssignmentManager#updateTimer.
We do the test for bulk assigning 10w (i.e. 100k) regions, the whole process of bulk assigning took 1 hours.
2012-05-06 20:31:49,201 INFO org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.AssignmentManager: Bulk assigning 100000 region(s) round-robin across 5 server(s)
2012-05-06 21:26:32,103 INFO org.apache.hadoop.hbase.master.AssignmentManager: Bulk assigning done
I think we could do the improvement for the AssignmentManager#updateTimer: Make a thread do this work.
After the improvement, it took only 4.5mins
