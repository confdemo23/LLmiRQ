When deleting a directory, use FileUtil.fullyDelete instead of FileSystem.delete
FileUtil.fullyDelete properly deletes a directory by deleting its contents first. While FileSystem.delete works on HDFS, it does not work on local file systems that do not permit a directory to be deleted if it is not empty.
