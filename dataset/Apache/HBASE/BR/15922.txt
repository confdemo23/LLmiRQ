Fix waitForMaximumCurrentTasks logic in AsyncProcess
In current implementation of AsyncProcess#waitForMaximumCurrentTasks, we have below codes:



while ((currentInProgress = this.tasksInProgress.get()) &gt; max) {

      ...

      try {

        synchronized (this.tasksInProgress) {

          if (tasksInProgress.get() != oldInProgress) break;

          this.tasksInProgress.wait(100);

        }

      } catch (InterruptedException e) {

        throw new InterruptedIOException("#" + id + ", interrupted." +

            " currentNumberOfTask=" + currentInProgress);

      }

}



Which will cause end of while loop if there&amp;apos;s any task done inside one loop making taskInProgress.get() no longer equals to oldInProgress
This is a regression issue caused by HBASE-11403 and only exists in branch-1/master branch, we could easily see the difference comparing to latest 0.98 code.
