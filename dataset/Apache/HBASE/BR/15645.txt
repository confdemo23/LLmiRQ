hbase.rpc.timeout is not used in operations of HTable
While fixing HBASE-15593, I find that we use operationTimeout as the timeout of Get operation rpc call (hbase.client.scanner.timeout.period is used in scan rpc), not the hbase.rpc.timeout.
This can be verified by add one line in TestHCM.setUpBeforeClass():



TEST_UTIL.getConfiguration().setLong(HConstants.HBASE_RPC_TIMEOUT_KEY, 3000);



and then run testOperationTimeout(), the test passes but it should have failed because we should get rpc timeout first after 3 seconds then client should retry and timeout again and again until operationTimeout or max retries reached.
If I port this test to 0.98, it will fail as expected.
