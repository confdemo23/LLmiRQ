coprocessor service requires .meta. to be available all the time.

HTable#getRegionLocations does not use a cache: all the calls to this function go to .META.
So:

we&amp;apos;re missing an opportunity to reuse/update the location cache in the HConnection.
this method is called by the coprocessor service. So, for people using this features, they have .meta. on their execution path, and it&amp;apos;s not good for performances, scalability and reliability.

I&amp;apos;m not totally clear on the fix. I think it should be possible to use the cache to see if we have all regions for the table. But it means we won&amp;apos;t always have the last version when calling getRegionLocations.
Any thought on this?
