HFileOutputFormat writes output to "unsafe" directory
HFileOutputFormat writes data direct to output folder. It&amp;apos;s incorrect as failed (or killed, or interrupted) reducers leaves inconsistent files in output folder.
The convinient way to ouput data from OutputFormat is to use "working directory". The content of this directory is being moved to output directory at the end of reducer process if only reducer succeeded (this process is called "output commit" or "atomic commit").
If means that instead of
 final Path outputdir = FileOutputFormat.getOutputPath(context);
hbase should use
 final Path outputdir = FileOutputFormat.getWorkOutputPath(context);
