TableOperation doesnt format keys for meta scan properly
to scan the meta table, the start row must be in the format &amp;apos;table_name,,&amp;apos; - the commas are not optional.
I found another place in TableOperation which was missing this, causing hbase to close too many regions from unrelated tables (ouch!)
