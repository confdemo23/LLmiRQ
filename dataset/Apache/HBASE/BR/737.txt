Scanner: every cell in a row has the same timestamp
A row can have multiple cells, and each cell can have a different timestamp.  The get command in the shell demonstrates that cells are being stored with different timestamps:

hbase(main):008:0&gt; get &amp;apos;table1&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;row2&amp;apos;  
COLUMN                       CELL 
 fam1:letters                timestamp=1215707612949, value=def 
 fam1:numbers                timestamp=1215707629064, value=123 
 fam2:letters                timestamp=1215711498969, value=abc 
3 row(s) in 0.0100 seconds


However, using the scanners to retrieve these cells shows that they all have the same timestamp:

hbase(main):009:0&gt; scan &amp;apos;table1&amp;apos;  
ROW                          COLUMN+CELL
 row2                        column=fam1:letters, timestamp=1215711498969, value=def 
 row2                        column=fam1:numbers, timestamp=1215711498969, value=123 
 row2                        column=fam2:letters, timestamp=1215711498969, value=abc 
3 row(s) in 0.0600 seconds


The scanners are losing timestamp information somewhere along the line.
