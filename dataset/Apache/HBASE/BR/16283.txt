Batch Append/Increment will always fail if set ReturnResults to false
If set Append/Increment&amp;apos;s ReturnResult attribute to false, and batch the appends/increments to server. The batch operation will always return false.
The reason is that, since return result is set to false, append/increment will return null instead of Result object. But in ResponseConverter#getResults, there is some check code 



if (requestRegionActionCount != responseRegionActionResultCount) {

      throw new IllegalStateException("Request mutation count=" + requestRegionActionCount +

          " does not match response mutation result count=" + responseRegionActionResultCount);

    }



That means if the result count is not meet with request mutation count, it will fail the request.
The solution is simple, instead of returning a null result, returning a empty result if ReturnResult set to false.
