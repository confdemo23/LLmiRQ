Unhandled exception at regionserver
While starting hbase I get following exception:

java.lang.NullPointerException
  at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.HRegionServer.run(HRegionServer.java:459)
   at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:619)
in region server&amp;apos;s log on the second machine whereas at first machine all going well.
We&amp;apos;ve discussed with larsgeorge this problem at IRC channel and seems problem is in HRegionServer implementation.
Patch which fixies that problem attached to this message, but it should be not a final variant, because I cannot stop hbase with this fix.
