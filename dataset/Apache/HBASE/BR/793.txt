HTable.getStartKeys() ignores table names when matching columns

&gt; If you have the same column family name in other tables, the Test will
&gt; send the same rows to multiple map reducers.

&gt; Indeed, a bug in getStartKeys will make us process all tables that have
&gt; a column family name in common.

&gt; The above Visitor is visiting the meta table.  Its checking column
&gt; family name.  Any region that is not offlined or split gets added to the
&gt; list of regions.  Its not checking that the region belongs to the wanted
&gt; table.
