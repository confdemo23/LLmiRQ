TestReplicaWithCluster.testChangeTable timeout
In our internal test TestReplicaWithCluster.testChangeTable got a timeout.  
HBASE-12170 bumped TestReplicaWithCluster.testReplicaAndReplication timeout from 2 minutes to 5 minutes, but leaves other tests in the same package unchanged.
When I run the test in my fast Mac, the run time of TestReplicaWithCluster.testChangeTable (~16 seconds) is about half of TestReplicaWithCluster.testReplicaAndReplication (~31 seconds).  
We should increase the timeout in TestReplicaWithCluster.testChangeTable to avoid test failure in slow environment.
