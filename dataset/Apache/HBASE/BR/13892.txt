Scanner with all results filtered out results in NPE
Saw a failure during some testing with region_mover.rb



NativeException: java.lang.NullPointerException: null

        __ensure__ at /usr/hdp/current/hbase-master/bin/region_mover.rb:110

  isSuccessfulScan at /usr/hdp/current/hbase-master/bin/region_mover.rb:109

  isSuccessfulScan at /usr/hdp/current/hbase-master/bin/region_mover.rb:104

     unloadRegions at /usr/hdp/current/hbase-master/bin/region_mover.rb:328



To try to get a real stacktrace, I wrote a simple test. Turns out, it was really simple to just produce the NPE within ClientScanner.



java.lang.NullPointerException: null

	at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.ClientScanner.getResultsToAddToCache(ClientScanner.java:576)

	at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.ClientScanner.loadCache(ClientScanner.java:492)

	at org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.ClientScanner.next(ClientScanner.java:364)



Patch with fix and test incoming.
