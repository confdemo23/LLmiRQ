Improper timestamp checking with VisibilityScanDeleteTracker
3 issues
1. When VC is used and all the put cells and delete cells are not having any visibility associated with them, we are not correctly checking put cells ts against that of delete cell resulting in deletion of cells coming in after the delete ts
2. Have a row r1 with 2 cells of same TS but different visibility. In order to delete both cells we have to apply 2 deletes with these 2 visibility being set to Delete. We are trying to do this using delete full row option or delete cf way. But only one cell is getting deleted.
3. Same case as in #2 when I try to delete using family version delete, only one cell is getting deleted.
