HFile size is not considered correctly in a replication request
In a single replication request from source cluster a RS can send either at most replication.source.size.capacity size of data or replication.source.nb.capacity entries. 
The size is calculated by considering the cells size in each entry which will get calculated wrongly in case of bulk loaded data replication, in this case we need to consider the size of hfiles not cell.
