regionserver carrying .META. starts sucking all cpu, drives load up - infinite loop?
the symptom is the cluster comes to a dead halt.  Lookups on meta don&amp;apos;t seem to work, and the regionserver carrying .META. goes hot - using 800% CPU or more, driving system LA up really really high (I&amp;apos;ve seen it as high as 26).  Thread dumps seem to indicate every IPC handler is stuck in Bytes.binarySearch().
