ResultSerialization and MutationSerialization can throw InvalidProtocolBufferException when serializing a cell larger than 64MB
This was reported in CRUNCH-534 but is a problem how we handle deserialization of large Cells (&gt; 64MB) in ResultSerialization and MutationSerialization.
The fix is just re-using what it was done in HBASE-13230.
