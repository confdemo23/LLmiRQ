Add bulk load hfile-refs for replication in ZK after the event is appended in the WAL
Currenlty hfile-refs znode used for tracking the bulk loaded data replication is added first and then the bulk load event in appended in the WAL. So this may lead to a issue where the znode is added in ZK but append to WAL is failed(due to some probelm in DN), so this znode will be left in ZK as it is and will not allow hfile to get deleted from archive directory.
