IllegalArgumentException was thrown when doing online configuration change in CompactSplitThread
Online configuration change is a terrific feature for HBase administrators. However, when we use this feature to tune compaction thread pool size online, it triggered a IllegalArgumentException. The cause is the order of setMaximumPoolSize() and setCorePoolSize() of ThreadPoolExecutor: when turning parameters bigger, we should setMax first; when turning parameters smaller, we need to setCore first. Besides, there is also a copy-code bug in merge and split thread pool which I will fix together.
