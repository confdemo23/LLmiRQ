Missing rows after medium intensity insert
This bug was uncovered by Mathias in his mail "Issue on data load with 0.20.0-rc2". Basically, somehow, after a medium intensity insert a lot of rows goes missing. Easy way to reproduce : PE. Doing a PE scan or randomRead afterwards won&amp;apos;t uncover anything since it doesn&amp;apos;t bother about null rows. Simply do a count in the shell, easy to test (I changed my scanner caching in the shell to do it faster).
I tested some light insertions with force flush/compact/split in the shell and it doesn&amp;apos;t break.
