ExportSnapshot does not honor -chmod option
Create a snapshot of an existing HBase table, export the snapshot using the -chuser, -chgroup, -chmod options.
Look in hdfs filesystem for export. The files do not have the correct ownership, group, permissions
Thanks to Ian Roberts who first reported the issue.
