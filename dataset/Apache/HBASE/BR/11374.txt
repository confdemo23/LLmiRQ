RpcRetryingCaller#callWithoutRetries has a timeout of zero
This code is called by the client on the "multi" path.
As zero is detected as infinite value, we fallback to 2 seconds, which may not may correct.
Typically, you can see this kind of message in the client (see the SocketTimeoutException: 2000)
