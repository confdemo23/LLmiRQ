HBaseInterClusterReplicationEndpoint retry logic is broken
In HBaseInterClusterReplicationEndpoint, we do something like this:



entryLists.remove(f.get());



where f.get() returns an ordinal number which represents the index of the element in the entryLists that just succeeded replicating. We remove these entries because we want to retry with remaining elements in the list in case of a failure. Since entryLists is an ArrayList, the subsequent elements are shifted left in case we remove an element. This breaks the intended functionality. The fix is to reverse sort the ordinals and then perform the deletion in one go.
