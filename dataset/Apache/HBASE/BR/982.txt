Deleting a column in MapReduce fails
In latest trunk, deleting a column in BatchUpdate causes exception because BatchUpdate&amp;apos;s copy constructor (or whatever they are called in java) directly calls BatchUpdate#put even in delete-s thus causing put to throw IllegalArgumentException("Passed value cannot be null").
