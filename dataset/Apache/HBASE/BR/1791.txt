Timeout in IndexRecordWriter
A MapReduce job to generate Lucene Indexes from HBase will fail on sufficiently large tables. After the indexing finished, the close() method of IndexRecordWriter is called.  The  writer.optimize() call in this method can take many minutes, forcing most MapReduce tasks to timeout. There is a HeartBeatsThread, but it does not seem to send progress updates. 
A suggested fix may be to add context.progress(); in the HeardbeatsThread run() method, after the context.setStatus call. Not sure why context.setStatus is not "good enough".
