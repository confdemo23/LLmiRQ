Cleanup thrift server; remove Text and profuse DEBUG messaging
Ambiguous issue name.. sorry.
The thrift server has loads of getText(..) calls. Which is a local function that checks for utf8 compliance, we don&amp;apos;t need them anywhere, because we don&amp;apos;t use Text anymore.
There is probably other things we missed last time we updated the api, that we should also clean up while we&amp;apos;re at it. Open to suggestions.
