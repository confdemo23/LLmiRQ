0.20.0 TableInputFormatBase NPE
Spot the bug in this code:
public List&lt;InputSplit&gt; getSplits(JobContext context) throws IOException {
    byte [][] startKeys = table.getStartKeys();
    if (startKeys == null || startKeys.length == 0) 
{

      throw new IOException("Expecting at least one region.");

    }
    if (table == null) 
{

      throw new IOException("No table was provided.");

    }
...
}
Should check if the table is null before calling a method on it.
Admittedly, this isn&amp;apos;t the worst bug in the world, it&amp;apos;s really just more of a nuisance in that the "No table was provided" message becomes an NPE
