HBase migration tool does not get correct FileSystem or root directory if configuration is not correct.
The HBase migration tool does not validate hbase.rootdir as a valid URI that contains a scheme (e.g., file:// or hdfs://) and fails to find the root directory and the file system if hbase.rootdir is not a URI.
