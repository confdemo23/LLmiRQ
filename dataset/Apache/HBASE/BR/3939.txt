Some crossports of Hadoop IPC fixes
A few fixes from Hadoop IPC that we should probably cross-port into our copy:

HADOOP-7227: remove the protocol version check at call time
HADOOP-7146: fix a socket leak in server
HADOOP-7121: fix behavior when response serialization throws an exception
HADOOP-7346: send back nicer error response when client is using an out of date IPC version
