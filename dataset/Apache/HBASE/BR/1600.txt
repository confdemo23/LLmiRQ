Multiple HBase clients to multiple indpendent HBase clusters from the same jvm should be allowed
ZK quorum servers list is static in ZooKeeperWrapper and is coupled to zoo.cfg. 
This prevents multiple clients from connecting to multiple distinct HBase clusters and requires zoo.cfg to exist on a cluster that needs to connect to a remote HBase cluster.
