StoreFile Blooms are Being Stored Undersized
While looking through error logs today, I noticed the following line.



 2010-09-16 04:12:26,401 INFO org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.StoreFile: Bloom added to HFile.  9600B, 10292/6933 (148%) 



The last 3 numbers are: # of keys in bloom, # of keys preallocated for bloom, % full.  The last number should never be &gt; 100%.  Oversized blooms will cause increased false positives.  Note that this occurred on a Row+Col bloom.  Will provide more details after further instrumentation.
