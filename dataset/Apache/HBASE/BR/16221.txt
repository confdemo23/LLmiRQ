Thrift server drops connection on long scans
Thrift servers use connection cache and we drop connections after hbase.thrift.connection.max-idletime milliseconds from the last time a connection object was accessed. However, we never update this last accessed time on scan path. 
By default, this will cause scanners to fail after 10 minutes, if the underlying connection object is not being used along other operation paths (like put).
