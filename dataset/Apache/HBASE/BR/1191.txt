ZooKeeper ensureParentExists calls fail on absolute path
If user specifies absolute path for one of the files in ZooKeeper, the following will not do what it&amp;apos;s supposed to:
if (!ensureZNodeExists(parentZNode)) {
  ...
Because the user specified path is not a child of parentZNode, all operations on it will fail.
