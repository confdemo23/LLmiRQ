The current Thrift API does not allow a new scanner to be created without supplying a column list unlike the other APIs.
The current Thrift API does not allow a new scanner to be created without supplying a column list, unlike the REST api. I posted this on the HBase-Users mailing list. Others concurred that it appears to have been an oversight in the Thrift API. 
Its quite significant as there is no easy work around, unless you already know which the column families names then list them all when you open the scanner.
