HStore::close does not honor config hbase.rs.evictblocksonclose
I noticed moving regions was slow and due to the wait for the bucket cache to clear.  I tried setting hbase.rs.evictblocksonclose and it did not help.
I see the HStore::close method has evictonclose hard coded to true instead of letting the config dictate:
// close each store file in parallel
CompletionService&lt;Void&gt; completionService =
   new ExecutorCompletionService&lt;Void&gt;(storeFileCloserThreadPool);
for (final StoreFile f : result) {
   completionService.submit(new Callable&lt;Void&gt;() {
     @Override
     public Void call() throws IOException 
{

       f.closeReader(true);

       return null;

     }
   });
}
