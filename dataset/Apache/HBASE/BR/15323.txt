Hbase Rest CheckAndDeleteAPi should be able to delete more cells
Java CheckAndDelete API accepts Delete object which can be used to delete (a cell / cell version / multiple cells / column family or a row), but the rest api only allows to delete the cell (without any version)
Need to add this capability to rest api.
