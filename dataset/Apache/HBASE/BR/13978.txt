Variable never assigned in SimpleTotalOrderPartitioner.getPartition() 
See https://github.com/apache/hbase/blob/master/hbase-server/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/mapreduce/SimpleTotalOrderPartitioner.java#L104, which has an if statement that tries to limit the code to run only once, but since it does not assign this.lastReduces it will always trigger and recompute the splits (and log them).
