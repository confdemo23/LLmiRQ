AsyncRPCClient hangs if Connection closes before RPC call response 
The test for HBASE-15212 discovered an issue with Async RPC Client. 
In that test, we are closing the connection if an RPC call writes a call larger than max allowed size, the server closes the connection. However the async client does not seem to handle connection closes with outstanding RPC calls. The client just hangs. 
Marking this blocker against 2.0 since it is default there.
