Filter#filterRow is called too often, filters rows it shouldn&apos;t have
Filter#filterRow is called from ScanQueryMatcher#filterEntireRow which is called from StoreScanner.next. However, if I understood the code correctly, StoreScanner processes KeyValue-s in a column-oriented order (i.e. after row1-col1 comes row2-col1, not row1-col2). Thus, when filterEntireRow is called, in reality, the filter only processed (via filterKeyValue) only one column of a row.
