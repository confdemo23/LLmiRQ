Handle StoreFileScanner FileNotFoundException
Example:

Machine-1 is serving Region-X and start compaction
Machine-1 goes in GC pause
Region-X gets reassigned to Machine-2
Machine-1 exit from the GC pause
Machine-1 (re)moves the compacted files
Machine-1 get the lease expired and shutdown

Machine-2 has now tons of FileNotFoundException on scan. If we reassign the region everything is ok, because we pickup the files compacted by Machine-1.
This problem doesn&amp;apos;t happen in the new code 1.0+  (i think but I haven&amp;apos;t checked, it may be 1.1) where we write on the WAL the compaction event before (re)moving the files.
A workaround is handling FileNotFoundException and refresh the store files, or shutdown the region and reassign. the first one is easy in 1.0+ the second one requires more work because at the moment we don&amp;apos;t have the code to notify the master that the RS is closing the region, alternatively we can shutdown the entire RS (it is not a good solution but the case is rare enough)
