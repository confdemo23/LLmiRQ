Hostname returned by TableInputFormatBase.reverseDNS contains trailing period
TableInputFormatBase.reverseDNS makes a call to org.apache.hadoop.net.DNS.reverseDns which (at least in Hadoop 1.0.4) returns a PTR record.  PTR records contain a trailing period, which then shows up in the input split location causing the JobTracker to incorrectly match map jobs to data-local map slots.
