Compaction events should be written to HLog
The sequence for a compaction should look like this:

Compact region to "new" files
Write a "Compacted Region" entry to the HLog
Delete "old" files

This deals with a case where the RS has paused between step 1 and 2 and the regions have since been reassigned.
