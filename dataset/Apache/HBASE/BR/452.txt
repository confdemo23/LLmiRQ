"region offline" should throw IOException, not IllegalStateException
It would be nice if I could wrap my HTable.get calls in try {} catch (IOException e).  But that doesn&amp;apos;t work, since I also need to catch IllegalStateException.  I think that any time there is something wrong with hbase, hbase calls should throw an IOException (or subclass thereof).  Things like IllegalStateException should be reserved for programmer error.
