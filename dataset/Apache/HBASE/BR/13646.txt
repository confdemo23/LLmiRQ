HRegion#execService should not try to build incomplete messages
If some RPC service, called on region throws exception, execService still tries to build Message. In case of complex messages with required fields it complicates service code because service need to pass fake protobuf objects, so they can be barely buildable. 
To mitigate that I propose to check that controller was failed and return null from call instead of failing with exception.
