Introduce a new separator instead of hyphen(&apos;-&apos;) for renaming recovered queues&apos; znodes
hyphen is frequently used in the HostName. Likes we have one regionserver named "160-172-0-1", so under this scenario, 160-172-0-1 will be splited to 4 Strings and will be considered for 4 possible dead servers.
It won&amp;apos;t find all the logs for "160-172-0-1" any more, so causes data-loss.
