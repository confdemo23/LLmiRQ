IPC interfaces with different versions can cause problems
This morning we ran into a situation in which some 0.2.x region servers started up and joined a 0.18.1 cluster. 
This &amp;apos;sort of&amp;apos; worked in that the hrs could communicate with the master, but clients could not communicate with the 0.2 region servers because the api version changed (the master wouldn&amp;apos;t have liked it if it had deployed root or meta there).
Suggestion is that we have a single api version that gets bumped when any of the interfaces changes.
