CopyTable: Cannot have ZK source to destination
During a Copy Table, involving --peer.adr, we found the following block of code:
if (address != null) 
{

        ZKUtil.applyClusterKeyToConf(this.conf, address);

   }

When we set ZK conf in setConf method, that also gets called in frontend when MR initializes TOF, so there&amp;apos;s no way now to have two ZK points for a single job, cause source gets reset before job is submitted.
