Disable table doesn&apos;t work reliably
When creating a couple of tables like this:
1) create an empty table
2) disable table, add new column family, enable table
3) put 100 small documents into newly created column
around once in 10 tries the disable doesn&amp;apos;t happen.
I have no clue as to why the table isn&amp;apos;t disabled in the first place, but if this occurs, two things in HBaseAdmin.disableTable() strike me as odd:

after numRetries tries to wait for disabling we exit the loop; there is no exception or error message:
...
2008-05-14 16:19:47,903 INFO org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.HBaseAdmin: Disabled table table31
2008-05-14 16:19:47,910 INFO org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Server: IPC Server handler 3 on 60000, call addColumn(table31, 
{name: document, max versions: 3, compression: NONE, in memory: false, block cache enabled: false, max length: 2147483647, time to live: FOREVER, bloom filter: none}
) from XXX.XX.40.36:47116: error: org.apache.hadoop.hbase.TableNotDisabledException: table31
...


the scanner iterates over HRegionInfos of several tables. If any one of those is disabled, we also leave the loop as if the requested table had been disabled.

I&amp;apos;ve had this disabling problem occur quite reliably over the last days - today I couldn&amp;apos;t reproduce it, though HBase version hasn&amp;apos;t changed. ???
