Column length limit is not enforced
HColumnDescriptor provides for a limit on column value length but it is not enforced in 0.1.3 or 0.2.0 other than in the REST and Thrift APIs. (I thought it was enforced in some earlier revision but cannot find it).
Enforcement on the client side would be less complicated than doing it on the server side.
