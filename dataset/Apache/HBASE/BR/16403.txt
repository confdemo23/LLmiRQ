Upgrade guava version to the lastest one(19.0)
HBase client use the guava version 12.0.1, while elasticsearch sdk use the version 18+. It makes conflict, cause the constructor of StopWatch class is not public now.
We have to choose the es rest api to resolve the conflict.  Why not try to upgrade our dependency versions?
thx.
