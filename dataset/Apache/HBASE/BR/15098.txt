Normalizer switch in configuration is not used
The newly added global switch to enable the new normalizer functionality is never used apparently, meaning it is always on. The hbase-default.xml has this:

  &lt;property&gt;

    &lt;name&gt;hbase.normalizer.enabled&lt;/name&gt;

    &lt;value&gt;false&lt;/value&gt;

    &lt;description&gt;If set to true, Master will try to keep region size

      within each table approximately the same.&lt;/description&gt;

  &lt;/property&gt;



But only a test class uses it to set the switch to "true". We should implement a proper if statement that checks this value and properly disables the feature cluster wide if not wanted.
