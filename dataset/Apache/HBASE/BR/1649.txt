ValueFilter may not reset its internal state
ValueFilter#reset is empty even though the class uses two internal variables. These values are reset in filterRow, however there are instances where filterRow may not be called. For example, if you chain two filters through FilterList (with PASS_ALL and the second filter being a ValueFilter) then during FilterList#filterRow if the first filter#filterRow returns true then ValueFilter#filterRow will not be called.
