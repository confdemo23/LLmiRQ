Clarify that SimpleRegionNormalizer does not merge empty (<1MB) regions
SImpleRegionNormalizer does not merge empty region of a table
Steps to repro:

Create an empty table with few, say 5-6 regions without any data in any of them
Verify hbase:meta table to verify the regions for the table or check HMaster UI
Enable normalizer switch and normalization for this table
Run normalizer, by &amp;apos;normalize&amp;apos; command from hbase shell
Verify the regions for table by scanning hbase:meta table or checking HMaster web UI

The empty regions are not merged on running the region normalizer. This seems to be an edge case with completely empty regions since the Normalizer checks for: smallestRegion (in this case 0 size) + smallestNeighborOfSmallestRegion (in this case 0 size) &gt; avg region size (in this case 0 size)
