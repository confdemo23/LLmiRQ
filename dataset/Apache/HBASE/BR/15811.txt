Batch Get after batch Put does not fetch all Cells
A big batch put followed by a batch get does not always return all Cells put. See attached test program by Robert Farr that reproduces the issue. It seems to be an issue to do with a cluster of more than one machine. Running against a single machine does not have the problem (though the single machine may have many regions). Robert was unable to make his program fail with a single machine only.
I reproduced what Robert was seeing running his program. I was also unable to make a single machine fail. In a batch of 1000 puts, I see one to three Gets fail. I noticed too that if I wait a second after a fail and then re-get, the Get succeeds.
