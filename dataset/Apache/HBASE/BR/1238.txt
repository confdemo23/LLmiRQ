Under upload, region servers are unable to compact when loaded with hundreds of regions
We have a situation where each region server is loaded with 100+ regions, most of them in the same table. During a long upload of webpages, each memcache gets filled near equally fast so that the global memcache limit is usually triggered before the max memcache size. Since that emergency flush does not trigger compactions, the number of store files just keeps growing until it fails on all kinds of errors.
We need a better story for this as this is a "normal" situation.
