input buffer reading in the REST interface does not correctly clear the character buffer each iteration
when reading the input buffer in the REST interface the character buffer is not cleared for each iteration of the loop.  This can cause malformed data to be read from the input stream in cases where the input is greater than 640 characters.
See lines numbered 366-376 in org.apache.hadoop.hbase.rest.Dispatcher.java
I have prepared a patch for this.
