HRegion passes the wrong minSequenceNumber to doReconstructionLog
HRegion initializes by opens up all store files which may recover from the WAL. It then calls protected doReconstructionLog which THBase uses to go through the log and look for pending transactions that may need to be recovered. Currently HRegion is passing down the minSequenceNumber after WAL recovery. What we want is the lowest sequence number before the wal recovery.
