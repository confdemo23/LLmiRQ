region server should deleted restore log after successfull restore
Currently we do not remove the restore log "oldlogfile.log" after we reopen a region after a crashed region server.
Suggestion would be to remove after we successfully flush of all the edits to a mapfile
so something like:
replay log 
memcache flush
deleted log
