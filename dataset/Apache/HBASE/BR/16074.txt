ITBLL fails, reports lost big or tiny families
Underlying MR jobs succeed but I&amp;apos;m seeing the following in the logs (mid-size distributed test cluster):
ERROR test.IntegrationTestBigLinkedList$Verify: Found nodes which lost big or tiny families, count=164
I do not know exactly yet whether it&amp;apos;s a bug, a test issue or env setup issue, but need figure it out. Opening this to raise awareness and see if someone saw that recently.
