RowCount doesn&apos;t work
From Yair Even-Zohar

looked at the code in the 0.2.0 and the args[0] is used twice
   c.set("hbase.master", args[0]);
And
   // First arg is the output directory.
   c.setOutputPath(new Path(args[0]));
Was anybody able to use this class?
In fact it does not work and there is also a NPE that gets thrown.
