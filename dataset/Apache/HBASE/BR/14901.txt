There is duplicated code to create/manage encryption keys
There is duplicated code from MobUtils.createEncryptionContext in HStore, and there is a subset of that code in HFileReaderImpl.
Refactored key selection 
Moved both to EncryptionUtil.java
Can&amp;apos;t figure out how to write a unit test for this, but there&amp;apos;s no new code just refactoring.
