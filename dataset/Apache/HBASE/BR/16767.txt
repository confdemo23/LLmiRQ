Mob compaction needs to clean up files in /hbase/mobdir/.tmp and /hbase/mobdir/.tmp/.bulkload when running into IO exceptions 
For the following lines, when it runs into IOException, it does not clean up the files under /hbase/mobdir/.tmp and /hbase/mobdir/.tmp/.bulkload. 
It could be due to creating of new mob file or new reference file under .bulkload directory fails. Or when mob files from ./tmp to the mob region directory fails.
