Minimum memstore size is a percentage
We have a cluster which is optimized for random reads.  Thus we have a large block cache and a small memstore.  Currently our heap is 20GB and we wanted to configure the memstore to take 4% or 800MB.  Right now the minimum memstore size is 5%.  What do you guys think about reducing the minimum size to 1%?  Suppose we log a warning if the memstore is below 5% but allow it?
What do you folks think?
