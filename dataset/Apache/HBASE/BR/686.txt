MemcacheScanner didn&apos;t return the first row(if it exists), cause HScannerInterface&apos;s output incorrect
HTable.obtainScanner methods should return the start row if it exists, although HTable&amp;apos;s javadoc didn&amp;apos;t clearly desc. but i found the result of htable scanners sometimes contain the start row, sometimes not.
after more testing and code review, i found it should be a bug in HStore.Memcache.MemcacheScanner. in the constructor it set this.currentRow = firstRow, but when doing next(), there&amp;apos;s a this.currentRow = getNextRow(this.currentRow) before fetch result.
