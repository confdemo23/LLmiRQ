Fix the way hostnames and IPs are handled
From the list by Yabo-Arber Xu,

Yes, I&amp;apos;ve unlocked the port, and i am actually able to access from the web
UI with a client not running on EC2 to HBase at example.com:60010. It shows
all User Tables, but the Region Servers Address is the EC2 internal address:
domU-12-31-39-00-65-E5.compute-1.internal:60020.
I guess the client fails because it can not connect region server, which
serves only for an internal IP. However, in hbase-site.xml, I did configure
with region server explicitly in its external IP.
&lt;property&gt;
   &lt;name&gt;hbase.regionserver&lt;/name&gt;
   &lt;value&gt;ec2-67-202-57-127.compute-1.amazonaws.com:60020&lt;/value&gt;
   &lt;description&gt;The host and port a HBase region server runs at.
   &lt;/description&gt;
 &lt;/property&gt;
In fact we completely bypass the hostname set in hbase.regionserver, also the hostnames in the web UI are not the good ones. We should do that part like hadoop does.
