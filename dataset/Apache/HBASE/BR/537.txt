We no longer wait on hdfs to exit safe mode
We used wait on hdfs to exit safe mode before going on to startup hbase but this feature is broken since we moved out of hadoop contrib.  Now when you try start with hdfs in safe mode you get:

08/03/21 04:39:56 FATAL hbase.HMaster: Not starting HMaster because:
org.apache.hadoop.ipc.RemoteException: org.apache.hadoop.dfs.SafeModeException: Cannot create directory /hbase010. Name node is in safe mode.
Safe mode will be turned off automatically.

If you are lucky, it appears on STDOUT/ERR but may just be stuffed into logs and all looks like its running properly.
Noticed first by Lars George.
