IndexTableReduce doesnt write the column name as the lucene index field properly.
Instead of using the table column name as the field in the lucene index, the byte array jvm object id is written to the lucene index.  i.e.  [B@234DE3 instead of "myColFamily:myCol"
In the class IndexTableReduce, essentially one line of code needs to be changed as far as i can see to fix this issue.  I will be submitting a patch here within the hour.
