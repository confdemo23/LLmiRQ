Allow ZKAclReset to set and not just clear ZK ACLs
The ZKAclReset tool allows to clear ZK ACLs, which is useful if you are migrating from a secure to unsecure cluster setup.
If you want to make sure that your znode ACLs are correct, a -set-acls option, which allows to enforce the proper ACLs on the znodes in a secure setup, can be useful too.
