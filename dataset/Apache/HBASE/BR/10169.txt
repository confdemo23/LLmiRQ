Batch coprocessor
This is designed to improve the coprocessor invocation in the client side. 
Currently the coprocessor invocation is to send a call to each region. If theres one region server, and 100 regions are located in this server, each coprocessor invocation will send 100 calls, each call uses a single thread in the client side. The threads will run out soon when the coprocessor invocations are heavy. 
In this design, all the calls to the same region server will be grouped into one in a single coprocessor invocation. This call will be spread into each region in the server side.
