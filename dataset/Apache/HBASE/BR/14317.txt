Stuck FSHLog: bad disk (HDFS-8960) and can&apos;t roll WAL
hbase-1.1.1 and hadoop-2.7.1
We try to roll logs because can&amp;apos;t append (See HDFS-8960) but we get stuck. See attached thread dump and associated log. What is interesting is that syncers are waiting to take syncs to run and at same time we want to flush so we are waiting on a safe point but there seems to be nothing in our ring buffer; did we go to roll log and not add safe point sync to clear out ringbuffer?
Needs a bit of study. Try to reproduce.
