RegexpRowFilter behaves incorectly when there are multiple store files
I noticed that after running some table Map/Reduces, then using a
RegExpRowFilter to scan through the table,  the scanner misses
rows when its columns are in different stores.
This (rather convoluted) unit test provokes the behavior.

Set memcache flush size small to trigger multiple stores
put in 10 row with 2 columns. Each row has the same value for col1 (which the RowFilter wants to match)
Scan with and without the filter to be sure that we get all the rows with each
Run an identity table M/R 10 times to fill up the memcache and trigger flush.
Scan again. This time the filter does not pickup anything.

Attaching the log from this run as well.
