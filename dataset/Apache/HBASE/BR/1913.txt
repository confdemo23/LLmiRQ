Regionserver accepts connections, doesn&apos;t handle them after bad filter request
I deployed some new regionservers but forgot to include a library that one of my filters used.  When a client used that filter, the HBaseServer listener thread attempted to deserialize it, and threw a NoClassDefFoundError.  This killed the listener thread without cleaning up the socket (only Exception and OOME are caught, not other Error subclasses).  New clients continued to successfully open TCP connections, but the regionserver would never handle them, never shutdown, and the master would never expire it, so all of its regions were effectively unavailable until we intervened.
