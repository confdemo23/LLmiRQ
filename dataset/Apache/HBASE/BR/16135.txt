PeerClusterZnode under rs of removed peer may never be deleted
One of our cluster run out of space recently, and we found that the .oldlogs directory had almost the same size as the data directory.
Finally we found the problem is that, we removed a peer abort 3 months ago, but there are still some replication queue znode under some rs nodes. This prevents the deletion of .oldlogs.
