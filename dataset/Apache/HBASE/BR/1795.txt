log recovery doesnt reset the max sequence id, new logfiles can get tossed as &apos;duplicates&apos;
during log recovery, we dont reset Store.maxSeqId, thus new log entries are stamped starting off from the old files.  This can cause a problem if we fail and recover again, since the new mutations are deemed "old" and shouldnt be applied in a subsequent recovery scenario.
