[Regression] Cannot save timestamp in the future
0.20, compared to previous versions, doesn&amp;apos;t let you save with a timestamp in the future and will set it to current time without telling you. This is really bad for users upgrading to 0.20 that were using those timestamps.
Example:
 hbase(main):004:0&gt; put &amp;apos;testtable&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;r1&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;f1:c1&amp;apos;, &amp;apos;val&amp;apos;, 5373965335336911168
 0 row(s) in 0.0070 seconds
 hbase(main):005:0&gt; scan &amp;apos;testtable&amp;apos;
 ROW                          COLUMN+CELL                                                                      
  r1                          column=f1:c1, timestamp=1251223892010, value=val
