Javadoc for EqualsBuilder.reflectionEquals() is unclear
The Javadoc for EqualsBuilder.reflectionEquals() doesn&amp;apos;t explain that .equals() is used to compare non-primitive fields in the class.
Consequently, readers may assume the method recursively builds .equals() for all fields. We should clarify this.
