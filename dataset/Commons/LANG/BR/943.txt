Test DurationFormatUtilsTest.testEdgeDuration fails in JDK 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8, BRST time zone
While helping testing LANG-942 with JDK1.8 I always got three tests failing, while others had 2. After @britter fixed the issues related to JDK1.8, I continue getting errors with JDK1.8.
I decided to vote for [lang] 3.2.1 and test the tag with JDK 1.8 and a few others. However, I&amp;apos;m getting errors with any JDK, 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8 (build 121). Always the same error:
Failed tests: 
  DurationFormatUtilsTest.testEdgeDurations:467-&gt;assertEqualDuration:562-&gt;assertEqualDuration:575 expected:&lt;7[7]&gt; but was:&lt;7[6]&gt;
I get the same error with JDK 1.6 and the tag 3.1
Since the test is somewhat related to Time Zones (there are some Calendar&amp;apos;s, TimeZone.getDefault(), etc), here&amp;apos;s my locale and time zone:
