Javadoc incorrect for StringUtils.endsWithIgnoreCase
The javadoc for StringUtils.endsWithIgnoreCase() shows an example that appears incorrect.  It currently looks like the following:
    StringUtils.endsWithIgnoreCase("def", "ABCDEF") = false
I believe that should return true.
It also appears that the examples in the javadoc have the parameters backwards, as the signature shows the second parameter as the "suffix", yet the suffix in the examples is the first parameter.  The following sample I think would be more correct:
    StringUtils.endsWithIgnoreCase("ABCDEF", "def") = true
