StringEscapeUtils.escapeJava() behavior changed; backslash escapes &apos;/&apos; characters
StringEscapeUtils.escapeJava(String str) escapes forward-slash ("/") characters.  Prior to 2.4, this was not the case.  This is caused by the patch in LANG-363, which changed the behavior of StringEscapeUtils.escapeJavaScript(String str) to escape forward-slashes for compatibliity with IE.  The change was implemented in code common to both methods; StringEscapeUtils.escapeJavaStyleString() .
This side-effect change to StringEscapeUtils.escapeJava() is a problem in my project.  I don&amp;apos;t see any reason why it is necessary to escape forward-slashes in escapeJava(), so I suggest the behavior be changed so that escapeJavaScript() escapes forward-slashes, but escapeJava() does not.
