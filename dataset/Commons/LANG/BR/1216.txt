NumberUtils.isNumber bug
I found that when using NumberUtilsorg.apache.commons.lang3.math.NumberUtils.isNumber(version3.4) isNumber method the following phenomenon, 
when the parameter is 1.0 is true, but when the parameter is 0.1 is displayed is false.
When I use 0.1 as the parameter tuning isNumber method, 
view the source code in the method of the method of line 1370 discovered a problem.
When the analytical parameter is ". ", this time the chars [I] value is 46, direct return false.
I think to do so is not very reasonable, please give me your guidance.
