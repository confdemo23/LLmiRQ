StringUtils#capitalize: Javadoc says toTitleCase; code uses toUpperCase
The capitalize Javadoc says the code uses  Character#toTitleCase, however the code actually uses Character#toUpperCase.
Generally these produce the same result, but some charsets may have different characters for upper and title case - see for example the Javadoc [1] for Character#isTitleCase.
The way I read this, the character that looks like "lj" is lower-case, "LJ" is upper case and "Lj" is title case - i.e. not the same.
The question here is: should the code be corrected to use TitleCase or should the Javadoc be corrected to use UpperCase?
