Fix implementation of StringUtils.getJaroWinklerDistance()
The current implementation of StringUtils.getJaroWinklerDistance() does not compute the correct result in some cases. See #LANG-944 for the initial code contribution.
StringUtils.getJaroWinklerDistance("Haus Ingeborg", "Ingeborg Esser") == 0.0
This is due to the incorrect computation of common characters, which causes the algorithm to exit prematurely.
In contrast, the implementation in Lucene gives ~0.63, which is about right.
    JaroWinklerDistance d = new JaroWinklerDistance();
    getDistance("Haus Ingeborg", "Ingeborg Esser");
