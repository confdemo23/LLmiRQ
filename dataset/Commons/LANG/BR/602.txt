ContextedRuntimeException no longer an &apos;unchecked&apos; exception
The purpose of ContextedRuntimeException was to provide an &amp;apos;unchecked&amp;apos; exception with contexted features.  the fact that it now extends &amp;apos;java.langException&amp;apos; makes it a checked exception identical to ContextedException and doesn&amp;apos;t fulfill its purpose.
Recommend you either just remove ContextedRuntimeException (as it&amp;apos;s now redundant with ContextedException) or revert the change that has it extending java.lang.Exception back so that it extends java.lang.RuntimeException.  I would prefer keeping ContextedRuntimeException and having it extend RuntimeException.
I apologize for not catching this earlier.  I only caught it now in attempt to use ContextedRuntimeException on one of my projects and discovering that it is no longer unchecked.
Thanks for looking at this.
