StringEscapeUtils.escapeJava () not escaping forward slash correctly.
We are trying to escape forward slash using StringEscapeUtils.escapeJava ()  method. The output returned by this method is no longer a valid Java String. 
e.g. 
String s = "a/b/c";
System.out.println(StringEscapeUtils.escapeJava (s));
The output returned is a\/b\/c which is not a even a valid Java String.
This was working fine in 2.0 release of this jar.
