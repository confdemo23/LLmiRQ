Add containsAny(CharSequence cs, CharSequence... searchChars) to StringUtils
This method is missing from StringUtils. The corresponding method: 
public static boolean containsAny(CharSequence cs, char... searchChars) {
does exist, so this was probably just forgotten. 
Also
public static boolean containsIgnoreCase(CharSequence str, CharSequence... searchStr) {
needs to be added as well.
