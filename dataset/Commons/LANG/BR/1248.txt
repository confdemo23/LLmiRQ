FastDatePrinter Memory allocation regression
when the code was migrated from StringBuffer to Appendable in LANG-1152.
We&amp;apos;ve lost the ability to modify the buffer (setCharAt) 
The new implementation of appendFullDigits allocate a temporary char array to work around that limitation.
This is a major source of memory allocation which is not present in version 3.4.
