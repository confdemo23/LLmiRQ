DurationFormatUtils#formatDurationHMS implementation does not correspond to Javadoc and vice versa
This method has several flaws:
1. Javadoc says: "The format used is ISO8601-like: H:m:s.S." but the method call supplies "H:mm:ss.SSS"
2. ISO time never omits leading zeros, so the proper pattern must be "HH:mm:ss.SSS"
3. The method name says: "HMS" but includes the second fraction.
Since the use of fractions is optional, the method should use "HH:mm:ss" and update the Javadoc as well.
