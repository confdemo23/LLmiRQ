Testing with JDK 1.7
I ran the tests for the Lang 2.5 RC2 using JDK 1.7.0-b78 and they all passed except the testFormat() in FastDateFormatTest.
The problem seems to be that in JDK 1.7 the "yyy" and "y" patterns now cause a four digit year with SimpleDateFormat - whereas previous JDK versions resulted in a 2 digit year (as FastDateFormat does).
JDK 1.7 hasn&amp;apos;t yet been released and that may be fixed in the JDK by the time it is, but I thought it worth making a note.
