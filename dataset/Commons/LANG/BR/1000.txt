ParseException when trying to parse UTC dates with Z as zone designator using DateFormatUtils.ISO_DATETIME_TIME_ZONE_FORMAT
I have the String 2013-11-18T12:48:05Z which I want to parse into a Date using DateFormatUtils.ISO_DATETIME_TIME_ZONE_FORMAT. 
According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#UTC the Z at the end should be a valid abbreviation for UTC+00:00 (or UTC) and so all should be fine.
But when I am trying to do so I get the following exception:



java.text.ParseException: Unparseable date: "2013-11-18T12:48:05Z" does not match
