[lang] RandomStringUtils.random() family of methods create invalid unicode sequences
Problem are surrogate pairs: 
E.g. RandomStringUtils.random(int) may create strings with a high surrogate not
followed by a low surrogate character.
When processing them, we get errors in string-conversion-functions later on.
