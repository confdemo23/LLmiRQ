ArrayUtils.removeAll(Object array, int... indices) should do the clone, not its callers
The method ArrayUtils.removeAll(Object array, int... indices) currently sorts the input indices array. Therefore the array needs to be cloned; this is currently done by the callers.
However the sort is an implementation detail of the method, so should be done by the method itself, not by the callers, which is fragile (easy to overlook when creating a new method) and unnecessary.
This would also allow the method to be more easily changed to a different implementation that does not need to sort the array (e.g. using BitSet)
