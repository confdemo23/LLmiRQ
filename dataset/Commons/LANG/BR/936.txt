StringUtils.getLevenshteinDistance with too big of a threshold returns wrong result
StringUtils.getLevenshteinDistance(CharSequence s, CharSequence t, int threshold) specifies:

Find the Levenshtein distance between two Strings if it&amp;apos;s less than or equal to a given threshold.
When passing a threshold &gt; Integer.MAX_VALUE - max(s.length(), t.length()) the method always returns -1.
The simplest use case is passing Integer.MAX_VALUE (a common practice if one would want to find the min/max LD of a string to several other strings in an iterative fashion.
The code should be fixed to consider the threshold in relation to the source/target lengths, or alternatively the javadoc should be fixed to pronounce the current limit.
