Prepare Java 9 detection
In anticipation of Java 9 and JEP 223, the versioning scheme will change completely. We need to reflect that in SystemUtils, JavaVersion, etc.:

SystemUtils: Deprecate IS_JAVA_1_9 and replace with IS_JAVA_9
JavaVersion: Deprecate JAVA_1_9 in JavaVersion and replace with JAVA_9

and other places in the library.
