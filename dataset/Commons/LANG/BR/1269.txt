Wrong name or result of StringUtils::getJaroWinklerDistance
The name of the method StringUtils::getJaroWinklerDistance is misleading.
Currently for equal strings 1 is returned, for completely different strings 0 is returned. That is a measure of similarity, not of a distance. A distance must be 0 for equal strings. I read on the issues LANG-591 and LANG-944, that it was decided to have a similar name to StringUtils::getLevenshteinDistance, but that requires also the change of the methods result.
Could you please (1) rename the method to StringUtils::getJaroWinklerSimilarity or (2) change the method to return 1 - currentResult?
First option has the disadvantage to lose the similar naming of the similar methods, second option implies the risk to unnoticed introduce bugs in depending code. So I think it is preferable to use the first option.
