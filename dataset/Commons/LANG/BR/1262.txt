CompareToBuilder.append(Object,Object,Comparator) method is too big to be inlined
Issue is the same as in LANG-1218: CompareToBuilder.append(Object,Object,Comparator) is quite big, due to in-place arrays processing, and thus breaching inlining threshold (325 bytecodes):

....

o.a.c.l.b.CompareToBuilder::append (346 bytes)   hot method too big

....



This prevents CompareToBuilder object itself from being scalarized.
Fix may be the same, as in LANG-1218: extract arrays processing into separate method.
