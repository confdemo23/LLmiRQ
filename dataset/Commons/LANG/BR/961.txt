org.apache.commons.lang3.reflect.FieldUtils.removeFinalModifier(Field) does not clean up after itself
FieldUtils.removeFinalModifier(Field) calls setAccessible(true) on the Field it is working on but does not reset it to false when done, after the final modifier has been removed. Also the method does not need to call setAccessible(true) if the field is already accessible.

Only call setAccessible when needed
Refactor and add a new method removeFinalModifier(Field field, boolean forceAccess)
