DateUtils#parseDate uses default locale; add Locale support
Similar issue as https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HTTPCLIENT-471
Following line throws an ParseException on a German system:
d = DateUtils.parseDate("Wed, 09 Apr 2008 23:55:38 GMT", new String[] 
{"EEE, dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss zzz"}
);
Reason: parseDate internally calls SimpleDateFormat without providing a locale. This causes "MMM" to be interpreted using the system locale. If the system is German, the date is trying to be interpreted as German date.
I see following solutions:
 A) Always instantiate SimpleDateFormat with Locale.ENGLISH
 B) Make two instances of SimpleDateFormat. One without providing a locale and one with Locale.ENGLISH. Try two parsings
 C) Make as many SimpleDateFormat instances as locales are availble iterate over all instances at the parsing attempts.
 D) provide an additional (optional) parameter to parseDate for providing a Locale
I would prefer B) as this seems the best trade-off between internationalization and local usage.
What do you think?
