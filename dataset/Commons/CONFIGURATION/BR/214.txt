Adding an integer and getting it as a long causes an exception
Try this in a BeanShell:
bsh % p = new org.apache.commons.configuration.PropertiesConfiguration();
bsh % p.setProperty("foo", 6);
bsh % p.getLong("foo");
// Error: // Uncaught Exception: Method Invocation p.getLong : at Line: 3 : in file: &lt;unknown file&gt; : p .getLong ( "foo" )
Target exception: org.apache.commons.configuration.ConversionException: &amp;apos;foo&amp;apos; doesn&amp;apos;t map to a Long object
org.apache.commons.configuration.ConversionException: &amp;apos;foo&amp;apos; doesn&amp;apos;t map to a Long object
        at org.apache.commons.configuration.AbstractConfiguration.getLong(AbstractConfiguration.java:667)
The problem is that when an object in a property is not a Long, the only attempt of PropertyConverter.toLong() is that of treating it as a string. It could try to convert it to a Number first and then try to convert it to a long. It is a very confusing behaviour, because if you save and reload the properties everything works fine (as now the integer is a string).
