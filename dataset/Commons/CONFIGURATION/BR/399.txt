interpolator for reading environment variables
Hello there,
This is an extension of issue Id CONFIGURATION-284
The "env" interpolator prefix still does not seem to work. On investigation, I noticed that we have a new java class to support reading environment variables from different OSes, but there is no interpolator class (extending StrLookup) that supports the "env" prefix.
Could someone look into this? For the moment, I have put in a class myself locally. Will add to the repository once I find some time.. 
Regards.
