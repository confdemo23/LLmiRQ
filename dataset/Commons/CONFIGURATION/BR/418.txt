incorrect backslash parsing
I am using Commons Configuration (PropertiesConfiguration) and some of my data are windows shares: share1 or share2. The problem is the parsing return different things depending how the keys are defined. For example, these keys
share=\\\\share1
share=\\\\share2
are different than:
share=\\\\share1, \\\\share2
The first one returns two backslashes ("share1" and "share2") and the second returns just one ("\share1" and "\share2"). I think the problem is in PropertyConverter line 525, cos the backslash is hidden twice when multivalue parsing is done:
if (c != delimiter &amp;&amp; c != LIST_ESC_CHAR) 
                {

                    // no, also add escape character

                    token.append(LIST_ESC_CHAR);

                }

In my understanding the second condition produces this strange issue and it should be like this:

if (c != delimiter) 
                {
                    // no, also add escape character
                    token.append(LIST_ESC_CHAR);
                }

Check that cos I can be missing something...
TIA
