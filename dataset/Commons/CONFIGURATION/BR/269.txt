PropertiesConfiguration.save() generates superfluous escaping character when delimiter parsing is disabled
PropertiesConfiguration.save() ignores the delimiter parsing disabled flag and escapes all delimiter characters it encounters. When the configuration is loaded again (with delimiter parsing disabled) the values of affected properties contain the escaping character.
This bug is very similar to CONFIGURATION-268, but for PropertiesConfiguration.
