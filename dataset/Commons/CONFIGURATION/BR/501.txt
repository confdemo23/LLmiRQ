XMLPropertyListConfiguration swallows exceptions about invalid date properties
XMLPropertyListConfiguration.PListNode in its setDateValue() method just ignores parsing exceptions caused by invalid date property values. The values are not added to the newly created configuration object.
It makes sense that parsing is robust and error-tolerant. However, rather than simply swallowing exceptions, there should at least be a log output, so that users have a chance to determine that something went wrong during loading of a configuration.
Maybe we can later add a strict mode which fails on loading configuration files with invalid properties.
