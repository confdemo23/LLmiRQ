Cannot use DatabaseConfiguration if the datasource has autocommit = false
If using a DatabaseConfiguration object with a datasource that has autocommit = false, the setProperty method fails with a duplicate key error.
This happens because in the setProperty method the two calls clearProperty(key) and addProperty(key, value) can retrieve two different connections from the database.
