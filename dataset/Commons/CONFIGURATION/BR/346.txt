ConfigurationUtils.convertToHierarchical() does not correctly handle properties with multiple values
If a property has multiple values, the resulting hierarchical configuration will contain a node whose value is a list with these values. There should, however, be a single node for each value. Some queries, especially those containing indices, do not work on such structures.
