OSGI issue - configuration depends on Jexl 1.0 which does not have OSGI release
I updated to use commons-configuration 1.7 (from 1.6) and am running into the following resolution error under Eclipse Equinox OSGi framework.
        An Import-Package could not be resolved. Caused by missing constraint in bundle &lt;org.apache.commons.configuration_1.7.0&gt;
             constraint: &lt;Import-Package: org.apache.commons.jexl; version="0.0.0"&gt;
According to the Import-Package header in 1.7&amp;apos;s MANIFEST.MF, commons-configuration now has a required dependency on org.apache.commons.jexl.  Problem is, there is no OSGi enabled version of Apache Commons jexl that exports this package.
In jexl 2.0 the packages were renamed and org.apache.commons.jexl2 is exported.  The 1.x codeline, although using org.apache.commons.jexl, does not have the appropriate MANIFEST.MF headers to be used as an OSGi bundle.
As such, you cannot consume commons-configuration 1.7 in an OSGi environment.
