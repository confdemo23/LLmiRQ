If delimiter parsing is disabled, adding of list properties to an AbstractConfiguration does not work correctly
When calling addProperty() or setProperty() with a collection or an array as value it is expected that the single elements are added rather than the container. However, if delimiter parsing is disabled, this check is not performed, and the complex value is directly added. This causes strange effects, for instance when the configuration is saved: then the complex value is just converted to a string. Loading the same configuration again will then produce different values for those properties.
