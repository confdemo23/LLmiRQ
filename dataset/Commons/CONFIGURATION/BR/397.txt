Schema validation exceptions in a combined configuration often result in an empty configuration being include with no exception or error message.
When using DefaultConfigurationBuilder to construct a combined configuration using MultiFileHierarchicalConfiguration (the override file) followed by XMLConfiguration (the default file), if one of the override files has a schema validation error the exception is not thrown nor is an error logged. Instead, an empty configuration is returned.
If schema violation exceptions occur they should always throw exceptions, regardless of whether a file is optional or not.
