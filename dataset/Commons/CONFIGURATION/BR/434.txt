In HierarchicalINIConfiguration, after saving a property by calling setProperty() and save() methods, the contents after semicolon disappeared in the saved file.
Hi!
I am developing an application using Commons Configuration API.
And I got this problem.
In the ini file like this:
[Environment]
Application Type=any
Class Path=C:\Program Files\jar\manage.jar;C:\Program Files\jar\guiLauncher.jar;C:\Program Files\jar\appStart.jar;%USERPROFILE%;
I changed the value of &amp;apos;Application Type&amp;apos; from &amp;apos;any&amp;apos; to &amp;apos;gui&amp;apos; by using class HierarchicalINIConfiguration.
The value was successfully modified, but instead the value of &amp;apos;Class Path&amp;apos; was cut in the middle.
It is reduced like this :  &amp;apos;Class Path=C:\Program Files\jar\manage.jar&amp;apos;
In my opinion, the Configuration System regards the contents after &amp;apos;;&amp;apos; as comments, which disappeared from the file.
Is this a kind of bug? Or is there a way to show all the contents after &amp;apos;;&amp;apos; properly?
I appreciate if you give comments on this.
Thank you.
