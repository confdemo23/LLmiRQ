Handling of backslashes
Consider the following Unit Test:



    @Test

    public void properlyProcessesBackslash() throws Exception

    {

        final String key = "key";

        final String value = "\\\\";



        final XMLConfiguration xmlConfig = new XMLConfiguration();

        xmlConfig.addProperty(key, value);

        final StringWriter stringWriter = new StringWriter();

        xmlConfig.save(stringWriter);



        final String xml = stringWriter.toString();



        final XMLConfiguration roundTrippedXmlConfig = new XMLConfiguration();

        roundTrippedXmlConfig.load(new StringReader(xml));



        assertEquals(xmlConfig.getString(key), roundTrippedXmlConfig.getString(key));

    }



The test case fails and I think it shouldn&amp;apos;t. The version that introduced this behaviour was 1.7, 1.6 works fine.
