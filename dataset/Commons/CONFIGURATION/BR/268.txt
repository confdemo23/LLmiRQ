XMLConfiguration does not fully support disabled delimiter parsing
A call to setDelimiterParsingDisabled(true) should completely turn off the mechanism for searching for list delimiters and splitting property values.
However XMLConfiguration.save() escapes list delimiters even in this mode. When later such a configuration file is loaded and delimiter parsing is turned off, the values of affected properties will contain the escape character.
