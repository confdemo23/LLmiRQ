XMLConfiguration isEmpty has altered behaviour between 1.4  and 1.6
Given xml configuration file

 

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" ?&gt;

&lt;empty&gt;&lt;/empty&gt;






XMLConfiguration xml = new XMLConfiguration(file);

assertTrue(xml.isEmpty());



isEmpty() returned true on version 1.4 ?, now it returns false, and the configuration contains a single empty string as key.
Not sure if this should be considered a bug, but the documnetation reads: Checks if this configuration is empty. Empty means that there are no keys with any values, though there can be some (empty) nodes.
