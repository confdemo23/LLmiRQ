XMLPropertyListConfiguration doesn&apos;t handle empty dictionary correctly
Empty "dict" elements are not handled properly.   During printing of a configuration, configuration nodes that have no children and no value are assumed to be "strings" (see XMLPropertyListConfiguration.java:printValue()&amp;apos;s last "else" clause).   &lt;dict/&gt; is parsed in such a way (see startElement() and endElement() of that same file) that it ends up creating a configuration node with no children and no value.  Thus printing out a parsed property list will print &lt;string&gt;null&lt;/string&gt; everywhere an empty dictionary was in the input.
