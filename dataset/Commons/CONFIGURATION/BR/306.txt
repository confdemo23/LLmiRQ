INIConfiguration: Quoted values should not be trimmed
I am reading in .ini files with quoted strings.  Here is an example of a line:
CmdPrompt="[sdog@rosco ~]$ "
In Commons Configuration 1.4, this incorrectly reads in as "[sdog@rosco ~]$ ".  When I saw that this had been addressed in 1.5, I was excited... until I started using 1.5.  Now I don&amp;apos;t get quotes, but I also don&amp;apos;t get my trailing space, which is the reason I&amp;apos;m using quotes in the first place.  I expect the offending line is the final line in the parseValue(String) method of INIConfiguration:
line 403:
        return result.toString().trim();
Expected behavior: INIConfiguration should read in the exact string between the quotes, not a trimmed version.
I&amp;apos;m going back to 1.4 and my own code to strip the quotes.  Please address this as I cannot move to future versions without it.
