In HierarchicalConfiguration$Node visits the ConfigurationKey  points to the parent path in visitAfterChildren call
When visiting a child the key is aggregated to have the child node name, and a call to visitBeforeChildren and grandChildren&amp;apos;s visits are made.
However, before calling  visitAfterChildren,  the resetting of the key to that of it&amp;apos;s parent&amp;apos;s, seems inconsistent.
