BaseConfiguration.clone() does not work with list properties
In the clone() implementation the map storing the configuration data is also cloned. For properties with multiple values this map contains lists. Because no deep clone is performed these lists are simply copied into the cloned map. So if the corresponding properties are changed on either the original or the clone, the other object is affected, too.
