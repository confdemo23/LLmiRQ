ConfigurationDynaBean does not work well with all types of configurations
The current implementation of ConfigurationDynaBean makes some assumptions about the underlying Configuration object that are not met by all configuration implementations. Especially setting values for indexed properties by calling getList() and manipulating mapped properties through a subset configuration do not work for configurations derived from HierarchicalConfiguration.
