ConfigurationDynaBean does not work as advertised regarding indexed properties
The Javadoc of ConfigurationDynaBean says: "Setting an indexed property always throws an exception." However, there is a reasonable implementation for setting indexed properties.
The get() method for indexed properties tries to figure out whether a property is indexed and throws an exception if not. However, it does not discover all cases of invalid access to non-indexed properties.
