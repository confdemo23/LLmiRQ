Possible ClassCastException in CompositeConfiguration if a special in-memory configuration is used
Some methods of CompositeConfiguration expect that the in-memory configuration is of type BaseConfiguration (a configuration of this type is created if no specific in-memory configuration was provided).
However, there are constructors accepting an arbitrary Configuration object as in-memory configuration. If here a configuration is specified which does not extend BaseConfiguration, the casts performed by these methods will fail. The casts should only be performed if possible.
The following methods are affected:

setListDelimiter()
setDelimiterParsingDisabled()
