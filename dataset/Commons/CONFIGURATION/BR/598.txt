There are 2 different ConfigurationBuilder interfaces
(This is my first time entering a bug here; at least searching with ConfigurationBuilder here did not bring any relevant issues so I wanted to post this)
There are 2 different ConfigurationBuilder interfaces: 
one is org.apache.commons.configuration2.ConfigurationBuilder and other is
org.apache.commons.configuration2.builder.ConfigurationBuilder
The base package has 



Configuration 	getConfiguration()



while the builder package has 



T 	getConfiguration()



and the (&lt;T extends Configuration&gt; as generic parameter in the interface)
I assume this is a bug, since nothing implements the base package one and all ConfigurationBuilder implementations implement the one in the builder subpackage. It is at least confusing in case the base package one is intended just for clients to implement. Also documentation points to the builder package one.
