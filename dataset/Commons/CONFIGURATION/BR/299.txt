Interpolation of ${const:xxx} variables can cause a ClassCastException
If ConstantLookup is used for resolving a variable that is of a different type than String, a ClassCastException can be thrown:
The first access to this variable obtains the value and stores it in an internal cache. If this variable is requested again, the value is fetched from the cache and a type cast to String is performed. This will fail with a ClassCastException.
