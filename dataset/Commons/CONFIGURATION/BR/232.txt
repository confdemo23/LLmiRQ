ConfigurationUtils spews directly on std.err when exceptions
ConfigurationUtils:
public static URL locate(String base, String name) {
  3 x :
  catch ([Malformed|IO]URLException e) 
{
    e.printStackTrace();
  }
}
.. say no more.
But while we&amp;apos;re at it, the log-message (which, for some reason, actually goes to a logger, not uglily to the system) states "Configuration loaded from ..", which isn&amp;apos;t true: The thing isn&amp;apos;t loaded yet; it will be loaded.  "Loading configuration from .." would be better, or maybe "Will be loading configuration from ..". In addition, these log-lines could state what was the "base", and in particular the case where it loads from "base path", the whole line reads wrong.
For example: "Loading configuration ["+name+"] from base path ["+base+"].." and similar for the other lines.
