HierarchicalConfiguration.subset(...) misses an entry with the key equal to the subset prefix.
Having a HierarchicalConfiguration with entries alike:
    test.sample = subset title
    test.sample.boolean = true
    test.sample.int = 123456
    test.sample.text = I wish it worked!
When performing subset("test.sample"), I get a configuration of only three entries, the "subset title" value is not present (should have an empty string key).
The behaviour is in contradiction to Javadoc of the Configuration interface http://commons.apache.org/configuration/apidocs/org/apache/commons/configuration/Configuration.html#subset(java.lang.String)
Seems to me, that the bug is hidden in iterating the cloned configuration, where only children of the clone are processed, but not the root itself.
