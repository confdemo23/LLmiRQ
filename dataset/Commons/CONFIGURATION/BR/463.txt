AbstractFileConfiguration.load(String filename) returns with current directory changed



    PropertiesConfiguration pc = new PropertiesConfiguration();

    ...

    for (String f : cl.getArgs())

    {

        pc.load(f);

    }



Invoked in directory /home/me/test with several relative paths, i.e. ./sub1/a.cfg ./sub2/b.cfg
First file loads successfully. Upon return from the first invocation of pc.load(f), the current directory has been changed to the absolute path of the loaded file (/home/me/test/sub1).  Thus, subsequent paths given as relative references to the original user.dir fail to be found.
If this is the expected behavior, it should be documented.
