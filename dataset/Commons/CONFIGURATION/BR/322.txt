ConfigurationDynaBean doesn&apos;t work with indexed properties stored internally as arrays
ConfigurationDynaBean is not fully tested for properties stored in the configuration as arrays. This case is rare because any array added to a configuration is automatically transformed into a List. To reproduce this issue the configuration must be a wrapper of a source that already contains an array, such as a MapConfiguration or a JNDIConfiguration.
