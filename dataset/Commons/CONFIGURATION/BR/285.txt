<configuration fileName="local-configuration.xml" config-optional="true" /> does not report parsing errors in local-configuration.xml
I&amp;apos;m trying to build a configuration system to be shared between our Java applications.  I therefore want to have optional configurations included from the main configuration file read by DefaultConfigurationBuilder
&lt;configuration fileName="local-configuration.xml" config-optional="true" /&gt;
I have found that if the sub-configuration file is invalid the error is silently ignored.  The same without config-options="true" results in a ConfigurationException to be thrown (which wraps a ConfigurationRuntimeException which wraps the ConfigurationException which wraps the SAXException).
I believe that the behaviour is incorrect.  The sub-configuration file should be skipped if not found, but any errors found when parsing the existing file should be logged.
