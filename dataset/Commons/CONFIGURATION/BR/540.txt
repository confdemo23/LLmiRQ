SystemConfiguration copies System.getProperties() instead of directly using it since 1.8
In commons-configuration-1.7 the SystemConfiguration directly used the Map of System.getProperties(). Thus when changing the properties inside the SystemConfiguration, the changes were visible in the Map of System.getProperties().
Since commons-configuration-1.8 the SystemConfiguration creates a new Map as a copy of System.getProperties() and thus changes in the SystemConfiguration Map are not visible in the System.getProperties() Map.
In 1.7 this super constructor is used by SystemProperties:



public MapConfiguration(Map map) {

    this.map = map;

}



In 1.9 this super constructor is used by SystemProperties:



public MapConfiguration(Properties props) {

    map = convertPropertiesToMap(props);

}



A fix could look like this:



public SystemConfiguration() {

    super((Map)System.getProperties());

}



This breaks the functionality I expected to be able to use SystemConfiguration as a replacement API for accessing and manipulating SystemProperties. For me this is a regression.
My workaround is currently not to use:



new SystemConfiguration();



but instead use:



new MapConfiguration((Map) System.getProperties());
