SystemConfiguration can not get the correct system property
Currently the SystemConfiguration does not handle the scenario like below
  System.setProperty("demoId", "demoValue");
  SystemConfiguration sysConf = new SystemConfiguration ();
  System.setProperties(new Properties(System.getProperties())));
 System.setProperty("demoId", "newDemoValue");
 String propertyFromSysConf = sysConf.getProperty("demoId")
In the above code the value of propertyFromSysConf is demoValue but not newDemoValue, and I think the correct value should be newDemoValue
