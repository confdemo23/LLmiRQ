FileConfiguration getFile(), getFileName(), getBasePath() are not always consistent
Taken from the maillinglist:
&gt; I have a properties configuration which is loaded without a problem.
&gt; Later in my application I will access the file which is aligned to 
&gt; this configuration.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; final IFileConfiguration _productConf = 
&gt; _conf.getProductConfigurations().get(_productId);
&gt; 
&gt; log.debug("product conf file " + _productConf.getFile());
&gt; 
&gt; log.debug("product conf filename " + _productConf.getFileName());
&gt; 
&gt; log.debug("product conf base path " + _productConf.getBasePath());
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; The methods _productConf.getFile() and _productConf.getFileName() 
&gt; returning null but the getBasePath() returns a path which is correct 
&gt; (like file:/C:/Projects/workspace/myProject/project.properties). Seems 
&gt; for me like a bug because the PropertiesConfiguration is loaded 
&gt; correct and works.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; By side: I have also set a file reloading strategy for this 
&gt; configuration.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Any ideas what&amp;apos;s happen in this case or where I can find the problem? 
&gt; It would be nicer to get the File() instead the BasePath which has to 
&gt; be converted into a URL before I can access the whole properties file.
&gt; 
&gt;  
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks in advance,
&gt;

Thomas,
you are right, the conversions between a base path, a file name, and a File are not always consistent. How did you load the configuration (this determines, which internal fields are set)?
I would recommend to work with URLs, i.e. the method getURL(). A file-based configuration&amp;apos;s URL is always defined.
If you like, you can open a Jira ticket for this problem.
Thanks.

The file is loaded in this way:
_productConf = new ProductConfiguration();
_productConf.load(FileTools.getPathForList(_propductPathList).getPath());
means the load method gets an String and not an File.
