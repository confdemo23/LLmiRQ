Satisfies CollectionUtils Method
Recently I needed a method to verify that a predicate held true for all members of a collection.  I saw where CollectionUtils had the exists method that checked for a single list element that satisfied a predicate, but not a method for all elements.
Hoping to get more involved with the project!
