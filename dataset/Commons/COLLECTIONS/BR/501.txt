Rename MultiKeyMap.remove(K key1, K key2) to avoid clashes with newly introduced default methods in Java 8
Java 8 will introduce new default methods for the Map interface which clash with the existing method "V remove(K key1, K key2)" in our MultiKeyMap interface.
To avoid future problems rename the method (and other similar methods with more multi key arguments) to a more specific version:

V removeMultiKey(K key1, K key2, ...)
V removeKey(K key1, K key2, ...)
