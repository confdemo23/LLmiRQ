MultiValueMap put and putAll do not return the correct values
MultiValueMap put and putAll do not return the correct values.
putAll(Object, Collection) should return true if the map is changed. But if the key is new then this behaviour fails.
put(Object, Object) should return the added value if the map is changed. But if the key is new then this behaviour fails.
This was hidden because the test case referred to MultiHashMap and not MultValueMap.
