LRUMap constructor javadoc and behavior are inconsistent (maxSize cannot be less than 0)
The LRUMap constructor specifies "@param maxSize  the maximum size of the map, -1 for no limit"
The first line is then:
        if (maxSize &lt; 1) 
{
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("LRUMap max size must be greater than 0");
        }

There is nothing wrong with allowing a negative maxSize. This way the map can be used to order elements relative to access time. I think the above code should be remove and the javadoc should stay the same.
