probably apidoc error: firstKey() and lastKey() in AbstractLinkedMap
In the apidoc or source of org.apache.commons.collections.map.AbstractLinkedMap.firstKey(), it is said that this method "Gets the first key in the map, which is the most recently inserted.", which is exactly the actual behavior of lastKey(), and vice versa. 
So I think there is a typo with this class&amp;apos; javadoc.
