Rename MultiMap.remove(K, V) to avoid clashes with newly introduced default methods in Java 8
Java 8 will introduce new default methods for the Map interface which clash with the existing method "V remove(K key, V value)" in our MultiMap interface.
To avoid future problems rename the method to a more specific version and change the return type to be more logical. Brief discussion on the ml favored either:

boolean removeMapping(K key, V value)
boolean removeValue(K key, V value)
