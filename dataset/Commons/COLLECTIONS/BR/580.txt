Arbitrary remote code execution with InvokerTransformer
With InvokerTransformer serializable collections can be build that execute arbitrary Java code. sun.reflect.annotation.AnnotationInvocationHandler#readObject invokes #entrySet and #get on a deserialized collection. If you have an endpoint that accepts serialized Java objects (JMX, RMI, remote EJB, ...) you can combine the two to create arbitrary remote code execution vulnerability.
I don&amp;apos;t know of a good fix short of removing InvokerTransformer or making it not Serializable. Both probably break existing applications.
This is not my research, but has been discovered by other people.
