put() and putAll() don&apos;t update the getKeys() map
If you use the put() or putAll() methods of the ExtendedProperties class, it will  not update the contents of the internal keysAsListed map which in turn will return a different list of keys using the getKeys() method than the keySet() method does.
The attached patchs fix this behaviour and add test cases.
