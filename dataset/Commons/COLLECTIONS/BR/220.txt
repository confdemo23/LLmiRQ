Serialization/Deserialization doesn&apos;t work well with empty buffers.
When I serialize the queue to disk an it has elements, all works ok, but when I serialize an empty queue I have some problems when I create a new object using the serialized file.
When I deserialize the queue it has a &amp;apos;buffer&amp;apos; with size 1 (with null content), &amp;apos;tail&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;head&amp;apos; fields are 0 (they are declared transient). So, when I try to add a new object to the queue, the sentence:
 Object[] tmp = new Object[((buffer.length - 1) * 2) + 1];
Is executed in the add() method to increase the buffer length, but the buffer remains with the same size! (buffer.length = 1 --&gt; (1 - 1) * 2 + 1 = 1). So, the object is added and when the tail is going to be incremented, it is reset to 0!! 
    private int increment(int index) {
        index++;
        if (index &gt;= buffer.length) 
{
            index = 0;
        }
        return index;
    }
So it is impossible to add new elements after an empty queue has been serialized / deserialized.
I attach a simple TestCase where this is proved. The example works when you use XMLEncoder to serialize the buffer but doesn&amp;apos;t work if you use ObjectOutputStream or XStream.
