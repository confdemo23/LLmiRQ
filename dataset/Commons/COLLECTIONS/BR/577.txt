PatriciaTrie bugs when only a few bits change
I have a bug report for you, for the class AbstractPatriciaTrie.  
It has to do with how you handle bits when they are very close to each other.  
For example, some of your methods seem to think that if the only difference between a prefix and a longer string, is a single additional bit, then they are actually the same data.  Or if the only difference is some number of zero bits, then it also thinks they are the same data.  
There are also MANY situations where the prefixMap does not return all the strings that start with the prefix.
Can you also make AbstractPatriciaTrie public, and your other package level methods into protected level, that way I don&amp;apos;t have to copy the entire class and subclasse&amp;apos;s code out into another class just to extend it?
thank you,
