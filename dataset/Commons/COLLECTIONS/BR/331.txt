CollatingIterator NPE when Comparator is null
Run the attached Test against commons-collections-3.2.1. While the JavaDoc for CollatingIterator claims 
@param comp  the comparator to use to sort, or null to use natural sort order
the test fails, because the comparator is null.
Fixing this requires a change in org.apache.commons.collections.iterators.CollatingIterator.least(): 


if (comparator.compare(curObject,leastObject) &lt; 0) { ...


could be replaced with


int c = comparator==null?((Comparable)curObject).compareTo(leastObject):comparator.compare(curObject,leastObject);
if (c &lt; 0) { ...


The workaround is to provide a comparator, of course.
