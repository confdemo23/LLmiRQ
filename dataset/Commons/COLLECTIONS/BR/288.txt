Javadoc: incorrect behavior explained for ListUtils.transformedList
The contract stated for ListUtils.transformedList is wrong. The list is not transformed  it decorates the existing list and transforms NEW objects  EXISTING objects are not transformed. 
Compare this to the javadoc found in MapUtils.transformedMap:
"This method returns a new map (decorating the specified map) that will transform any new entries added to it. Existing entries in the specified map will not be transformed. "
That little missing piece of information messed me up. Just replace "map" with "list" and append it to the existing LilstUtils javadoc.
