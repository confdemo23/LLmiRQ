CompositeCollection, CompositeMap, CompositeSet should implement Serializable
These classes should implement Serializable as usually all generial collection classes do. (At least I cannot think of a reason why they shouldn&amp;apos;t and currently their usage is quite limited, like in RMI or http-sessions.)
