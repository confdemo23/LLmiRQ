Mutable fields should be private
Mutable fields should be private or possibly package-protected, never protected or public.
Once a field is published, it&amp;apos;s impossible to ensure that it is properly synchronised, and it is impossible to change the implementation without API breakage.
Only constants should be published.
If there is really a need to access the field externally, this should be done through getters/setters, as those allow synchronisation to be added and make it easier to change the implementation.
Also, it&amp;apos;s easy to add a getter/setter later if access is found to be needed.
Don&amp;apos;t add one &amp;apos;just in case&amp;apos; because it cannot easily be removed.
This observation applies to:
StreamOutput.out
CTRCipherInputStream.streamOffset
CTRCipherOutputStream.streamOffset
CipherInputStream - lots of protected mutable state
CipherOutputStream - ditto
