Multiple Regression newSampleData methods inconsistently create / omit intercepts
The newSampleData(double[], nrows, ncols) method used in the unit tests adds a unitary column to the design matrix, resulting in an intercept term being estimated among the regression parameters.  The other newSampleData methods do not do this, forcing users to add the column of "1"s to estimate models with intercept.  Behavior should be consistent and users should not have to add the column.
