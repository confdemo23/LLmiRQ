UnivariateRealIntegrator throws ConvergenceException
ConvergenceException is a checked exception, which goes against the developer&amp;apos;s guide. It occurs in the throws clause of some methods in package o.a.c.m.analysis.integration. It seems that these occurences are remnants from previous versions, where exceptions were probably checked. This exception is actually never thrown : it is safe to remove it from the throws clause.
