Method &apos;divide&apos; in class &apos;Complex&apos; uses a false formula for a special case resulting in erroneous division by zero.
The formula that &amp;apos;divide&amp;apos; wants to implement is
( a + bi )  /  ( c + di )  =  ( ac + bd + ( bc - ad ) i )  /  ( c^2 + d^2 )
as correctly written in the description.
When c == 0.0 this leads to the special case
( a + bi )  /  di  = ( b / d ) - ( a / d ) i
But the corresponding code is:
if (c == 0.0) 
{

    return createComplex(imaginary/d, -real/c);

}

The bug is the last division -real/c, which should obviously be -real/d.
