GaussNewtonOptimizer convergence on singularity
I am (ab-)using the GaussNewtonOptimizer as a MultivariateFunctionSolver (as I could not find one in commons.math). Recently I stumbled upon an interesting behavior in one of my test cases: If a function is defined in a way that yields a minimum (a root in my case) at a singular point, the solver crashes. This is because of the following lines in doOptimize():
catch (SingularMatrixException e) 
{

                throw new ConvergenceException(LocalizedFormats.UNABLE_TO_SOLVE_SINGULAR_PROBLEM);

            }

I would propose to add a convergence check into the catch-phrase, so the solver returns the solution in that special case.
