FastMath acos fails when input abs value is less than about 5.7851920321187236E-300 - returns NaN
FastMath acos fails when input absolute value is less than about 5.7851920321187236E-300
It returns NaN instead of an expected value close to PI/2.0
This appears to be due to the following code:



// Compute ratio r = y/x

double r = y/x;

temp = r * 1073741824.0;



r and temp can become infinite or Nan.
