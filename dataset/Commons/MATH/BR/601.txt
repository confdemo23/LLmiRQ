SingularValueDecompositionImpl psuedoinverse is not consistent with Rank calculation
In the SingularValueDecompositionImpl&amp;apos;s internal private class Solver, a pseudo inverse matrix is calculated:
In lines 2600-264 we have:
                if (singularValues[i] &gt; 0) 
{

                 a = 1 / singularValues[i];

                }
 else 
{

                 a = 0;

                }

This is not consistent with the manner in which rank is determined (lines 225 to 233). That is to say a matrix could potentially be rank deficient, yet the psuedoinverse would still include the redundant columns... 
Also, there is the problem of very small singular values which could result in overflow.
