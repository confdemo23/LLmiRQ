Integer overflows MannWhitneyUTest#mannWhitneyU
In the calculation of MannWhitneyUTest#mannWhitneyU there are two instances where the lengths of the input arrays are multiplied together. Because Array#length is an integer this means that the effective maximum size of your dataset until reaching overflow is Math.sqrt(Integer.MAX_VALUE).
The following is a link to a diff, with a test the exposes the issue, and a fix (casting lengths up into doubles before multiplying).
