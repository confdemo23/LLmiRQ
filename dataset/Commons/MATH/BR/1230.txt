SimplexSolver returning wrong answer from optimize
SimplexSolver fails for the following linear program:
min 2x1 +15x2 +18x3
Subject to
  -x1 +2x2  -6x3 &lt;=-10
            x2  +2x3 &lt;= 6
   2x1      +10x3 &lt;= 19
    -x1  +x2       &lt;= -2
    x1,x2,x3 &gt;= 0
Solution should be
x1 = 7
x2 = 0
x3 = 1/2
Objective function = 23
Instead, it is returning
x1 = 9.5
x2 = 1/8
x3 = 0
Objective function = 20.875
