BrentOptimizer: User-defined check block is badly placed
The CM implementation of Brent&amp;apos;s original algorithm was supposed to allow for a user-defined stopping criterion (in addition to Brent&amp;apos;s default one).
However, it turns out that this additional block of code is not at the right location, implying an unwanted early exit.
