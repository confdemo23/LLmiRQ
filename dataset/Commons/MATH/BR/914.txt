Inconsistent multi-start randomization (optimizers)
In class "o.a.c.m.optim.BaseMultiStartMultivariateOptimizer", the "starting points" generator is passed at construction. But random initial guesses must fulfill the bound constraint and be somehow related to the user-supplied initial guess; and those are passed to the "optimize" method and thus can change from one call to the other, leading to inconsistent (and probably useless) multi-starts.
