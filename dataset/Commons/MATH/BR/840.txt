Failures in "FastMathTestPerformance" when testRuns >= 10,000,002
Tests for methods "asin" and "acos" fail because they use



i / 10000000.0



as the argument to those methods, where "i" goes from 0 to the value of "testRuns" minus one (if "testRuns" is defined).
A solution is to replace the above with



i / (double) RUNS
