"CMAESOptimizer" silently changes invalid input
The "lambda" input parameter must be strictly positive. But when it&amp;apos;s not the case, an undocumented default is used (cf. line 526).
When a precondition is not satisfied, the code must throw an exception.
Instead of the code unknowingly changing the input, it is rather the documentation that should suggest a good default.
This change would allow to make "lambda" a constant (final) field.
