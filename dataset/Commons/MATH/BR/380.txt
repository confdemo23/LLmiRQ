Need to (re)initialize dYdY0 for multiple integrate with FirstOrderIntegratorWithJacobians
There is a lack in the method integrate of FirstOrderIntegratorWithJacobians. The jacobian DYDY0 can&amp;apos;t be initialized by the user, unlike DFDP with DF0DP.
So, for several successive integrations, the matrix is reinitialized to identity and that is not what we might want.
