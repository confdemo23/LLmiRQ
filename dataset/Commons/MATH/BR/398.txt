MathUtilsTest uses Math.nextUp from Java 6
The class  org.apache.commons.math.util.MathUtilsTest uses the method Math.nextUp(double) which is only available in Java 6, not in Java 5.  This makes Commons Math dependent on Java 6 rather than Java 5 which is in conflict with item 5 at the top of Commons Math Overview.
