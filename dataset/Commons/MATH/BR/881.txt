Eliminate meaningless properties in multivariate distribution classes
The MultivariateRealDistribution interface includes the following properties which make no sense for multivariate distributions:
getSupportLowerBound, getSupporUpperBound, isSupportLowerBoundInclusive, isSupportUpperBoundInclusive
In addition, the following property makes sense, but is unlikely to be useful:
isSuportConnected
All of these properties should be deprecated in 3.1 and dropped in 4.0
