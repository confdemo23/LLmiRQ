MathUtils.round incorrect result
MathUtils.round(39.245, 2) results 39.24, however it should be 39.25, with default rounding mode BigDecimal.ROUND_HALF_UP.
I found that internally MathUtils.round multiplies the given number by 10^scale.
 39.245 * 100.0 results 3924.49999...5 , and after this the calculation is not correct any more.
