public method "laguerre" should be private
In class "LaguerreSolver" (package "o.a.c.m.analysis.solvers"), the method "laguerre" is public. However, it doesn&amp;apos;t make any sense to call it from outside the class (because its argument list does not contain the function whose roots must be computed).
The method should be made private.
