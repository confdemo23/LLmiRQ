Issue with "SmoothingBicubicSplineInterpolator"
I figured out that the name of this class is misleading as the implementation doesn&amp;apos;t perform the intended smoothing.
In order to solve this issue, I propose to:

deprecate the "SmoothingBicubicSplineInterpolator" class
create a "BicubicSplineInterpolator" class (similar to the above class but with the useless code removed)
remove the "SmoothingBicubicSplineInterpolatorTest" class
add a "BicubicSplineInterpolatorTest" with essentially the same contents as the above one

Then I would also add a new "SmoothingPolynomialBicubicSplineInterpolator" where I used the "PolynomialFitter" class to smooth the input data along both dimensions before the interpolating function is computed.
Does someone object to these changes?
