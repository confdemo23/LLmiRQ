Cost in least-squares fitting
In org.apache.commons.math4.fitting.leastsquares.AbstractEvaluation, the value returned by the "getCost" method is not consistent with the definition of "cost" in a least-squares problem: It is the sum of the squares of the residuals, but the method returns the square-root of that quantity.
