MathUtils round method should propagate rather than wrap Runitme exceptions
MathUtils.round(double, int, int) can generate IllegalArgumentException or ArithmeticException.  Instead of wrapping these exceptions in MathRuntimeException, the conditions under which these exceptions can be thrown should be documented and the exceptions should be propagated directly to the caller.
