Incorrect KolmogorovSmirnov Statistic for two samples 
kolmogorovSmirnovTest(double[],double[]) against the samples given below gives 5.699107852308316E-12 instead of 0.9793 (approx.) Traced the issue to kolmogorovSmirnovStatistic(double[],double[]) which gives 0.49507389162561577 instead of 0.064 (verified with ks.test in R and JDistlib)
