Distribution tests are mostly meaningless due to high tolerance
The tolerance used for value comparison in IntegerDistributionAbstractTest is 1E-4. However, most values being compared are much smaller, so they are considered equal even if they otherwise differ by orders of magnitude. For example, a typo in GeometricDistributionTest puts 29 in the test points instead of 19, while the test probability value is correctly given for 19. The test passes, disregarding the fact that 2.437439e-05 (test value for 19) and 1.473826e-07 (actual value for 29) differ almost hundredfold.
