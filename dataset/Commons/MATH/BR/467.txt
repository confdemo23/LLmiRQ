HarmonicCoefficientsGuesser.sortObservations() potentlal NPE warning
HarmonicCoefficientsGuesser.sortObservations()
generates an NPE warning from Eclipse which thinks that mI can be null in the while condition.
The code looks like:



WeightedObservedPoint mI = observations[i];

while ((i &gt;= 0) &amp;&amp; (curr.getX() &lt; mI.getX())) {

    observations[i + 1] = mI;

    if (i-- != 0) {

        mI = observations[i];

    } else {

        mI = null;

    }

}

// mI is not used further



It looks to me as though the "mI = null" statement is either redundant or wrong - why would one want to replace one of the observations with null during a sort?
