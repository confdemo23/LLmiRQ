Incorrect rounding of float
package org.apache.commons.math3.util 
example of usage of round functions of Precision class:
Precision.round(0.0f, 2, BigDecimal.ROUND_UP) = 0.01
Precision.round((float)0.0, 2, BigDecimal.ROUND_UP) = 0.01
Precision.round((float) 0.0, 2) = 0.0
Precision.round(0.0, 2, BigDecimal.ROUND_UP) = 0.0
Seems the reason is usage of extending float to double inside round functions and getting influence of memory trash as value.
I think, same problem will be found at usage of other round modes.
