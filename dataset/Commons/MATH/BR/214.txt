fixed step Runge-Kutta integrators slightly change step size
When a fixed step Runge-Kutta integrator is used, it may slightly change the step size for all integration range.
This is due to a step recomputation feature which ensures the last step ends exactly at the end of the range.
This feature should be removed, since it is unnatural and does not obey users choices.
It should be replaced by the same kind of solution already adopted for discrete events: truncating only the last step.
