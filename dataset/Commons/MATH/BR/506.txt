The static field ChiSquareTestImpl.distribution serves no purpose
The static field ChiSquareTestImpl.distribution serves no purpose.
There is a setter for it, but in every case where the field is used, it is first overwritten with a new value.
The field and the setter should be removed, and the methods that create a new instance should create a local variable instead.
For Math 2.1, the field can be removed and the setter deprecated.
