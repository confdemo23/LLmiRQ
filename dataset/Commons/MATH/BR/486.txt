FastMath toRadian and toDegree don&apos;t handle large double numbers well
FastMath toRadian and toDegree don&amp;apos;t handle very large double numbers well.
For example, toDegrees(Double.MAX_VALUE) =&gt; NaN, but it should be INFINITY
and toRadian(Double.MAX_VALUE) =&gt; NaN instead of the proper value
This is because of the lines:



double temp = x * 1073741824.0; // == 0x40 00 00 00

double xa = x + temp - temp; // =&gt; NaN for x large enough



This seems to be an attempt to split x into a large and a small part, but fails when x &gt;= MAX_VALUE / 1073741824.0
Not sure how to fix this
