SparseRealVectorTest.testMap and testMapToSelf fail because zero entries lose their sign
Mapping Inverse to an OpenMapRealVector can lead to wrong answers, because 1.0 / 0.0 should return +/-Infinity depending on the sign of the zero entry. Since the sign is lost in OpenMapRealVector, the answer must be wrong if the entry is truly -0.0.
This is a difficult bug, because it potentially affects any function passed to OpenMapRealVector.map() or mapToSelf(). I would recommend we relax the requirements in the unit tests of this class, and make people aware of the issue in the class documentation.
