EmpiriicalDisributionImpl.getUpperBounds does not return upper bounds on data bins
Per the javadoc, the getUpperBounds method in the EmpiricalDistribution should return upper bounds for the bins used in computing the empirical distribution and the bin statistics.  What the method actually returns is the upper bounds of the subintervals of [0,1] used in generating data following the empirical distribution.
