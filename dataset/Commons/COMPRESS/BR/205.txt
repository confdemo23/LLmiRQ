Unit tests can fail when path to project is non-trivial (fix in description)
return factory.createCompressorInputStream(new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(new File(rsc.getFile()))));
can fail to find the files for testing e.g. /root/.jenkins/jobs/Commons%20Compress/workspace/target/test-classes/test.txt (No such file or directory)
This can be fixed by simply opening the stream from the URL:
    private CompressorInputStream getStreamFor(String resource)
            throws CompressorException, IOException 
{



        final URL rsc = classLoader.getResource(resource);

        assertNotNull("Could not find resource "+resource,rsc);

        return factory.createCompressorInputStream(

                   new BufferedInputStream(rsc.openStream()));

    }
