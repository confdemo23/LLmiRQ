Native Memory Leak in Sevenz-DeflateDecoder
The class ...sevenz.Coders.DeflateDecoder does not close (end()) the Deflater and Inflater. This can lead to native memory issues: see https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8074108.
In our case we create a zip archive with &gt;100000 files. The Java heap is around 300MB (with 2GB max). The native memory is increasing to 8GB and above. Because the Java heap has no pressure - no GC is triggered, therefore the Deflaters are not collected and the native memory is not freed.
