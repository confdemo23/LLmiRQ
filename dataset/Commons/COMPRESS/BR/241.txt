writing 7z entries with LZMA2 fails when closing the stream
closing archive entries that use LZMA2 compression fails on JDK8 early access build 113 due to:



org.tukaani.xz.XZIOException: Stream finished or closed

	at org.tukaani.xz.LZMA2OutputStream.flush(Unknown Source)

	at java.io.FilterOutputStream.flush(FilterOutputStream.java:140)

	at java.io.FilterOutputStream.close(FilterOutputStream.java:158)

	at org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.sevenz.LZMA2Decoder$FinishOnCloseStream.close(LZMA2Decoder.java:67)

	at java.io.FilterOutputStream.close(FilterOutputStream.java:159)

	at org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.sevenz.SevenZOutputFile.closeArchiveEntry(SevenZOutputFile.java:125)



Actually there is no need to explicitly finish the wrapped stream as XZ for Java&amp;apos;s LZMA2OutputStream which is returned by LZMA2Options#getOutputStream wll internally finish the stream when close is called.
