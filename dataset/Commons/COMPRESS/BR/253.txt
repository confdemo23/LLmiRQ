BZip2CompressorInputStream reads fewer bytes from truncated file than CPython&apos;s bz2 implementation
Jython includes support for decompressing bz2 files using commons compress and shares regression tests with CPython. The CPython test test_read_truncated in test_bz2.py passes under CPython but fails under Jython.
The BZip2CompressorInputStream is able to read 769 bytes from the truncated data rather than the 770 bytes that the CPython bz2 implementation can read.
