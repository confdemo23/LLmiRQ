TarArchiveInputStream fails to read PAX header from InputStream
We have a scenario with a "slow" InputStream and are facing IOExceptions with TarArchiveEntry#getNextTarEntry().
If the InputStream does not deliver fast enough, TarArchiveEntry#parsePaxHeaders(InputStream i) fails at this location:
TarArchiveInputStream.java


// Get rest of entry

byte[] rest = new byte[len - read];

int got = i.read(rest);

if (got != len - read){

	throw new IOException("Failed to read "

		+ "Paxheader. Expected "

		+ (len - read)

		+ " bytes, read "

		+ got);

}



We would suggest to change the code to something like this:
TarArchiveInputStream.java


// Get rest of entry

byte[] rest = new byte[len - read];

int got = 0;

while((ch = i.read()) != -1) {

	rest[got] = (byte) ch;

	got++;

	if(got == len - read) {

		break;

	}

}

if (got != len - read){

	throw new IOException("Failed to read "

		+ "Paxheader. Expected "

		+ (len - read)

		+ " bytes, read "

		+ got);

}



This would make sure, that it gets all bytes of the PAX header value.
