ZipArchiveInputStream and ZipFile don&apos;t produce equals ZipArchiveEntry instances
I&amp;apos;m trying to use a ZipArchiveEntry coming from ZipArchiveInputStream that I stored somwhere for later with a ZipFile and it does not work.
The reason is that it can&amp;apos;t find the ZipArchiveEntry in the ZipFile entries map. It is exactly the same zip file but both entries are not equals so the Map#get fail.
As far as I can see the main difference is that comment is null in ZipArchiveInputStream while it&amp;apos;s en empty string in ZipFile. I looked at ZipArchiveInputStream and it looks like the comment (whatever it is) is simply not parsed while I can find some code related to the comment at the end of ZIipFile#readCentralDirectoryEntry.
Note that java.util.zip does not have this issue. Did not checked what they do but the zip entries are equals.
