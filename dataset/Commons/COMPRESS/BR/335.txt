TAR checksum fails when checksum is right aligned
The linked TAR has a checksum with zero padding on the left instead of the expected NULL-SPACE terminator on the right. As a result the last two digits of the stored checksum are lost and the otherwise valid checksum is treated as invalid.
Given that the code already checks for digits being in range before adding them to the stored sum, is it necessary to only look at the first 6 octal digits instead of the whole field?
