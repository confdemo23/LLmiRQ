ZipArchiveInputStream does not show location in file where a problem occurred
See COMPRESS-62 - if ExtraFieldUtils.parse() detects an error, it only shows the offset within the local buffer, which is fairly useless in tracking down a problem.
Somehow the current location in the file needs to be determined and added to the Exception message.
The count/bytesRead field would help, but that actually points to the next available byte, i.e. after the problem area.
Also, the internal data may have been expanded.
