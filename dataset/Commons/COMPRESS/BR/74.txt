ZipArchiveInputStream fails to update count of bytes read
ZipArchiveInputStream fails to call count() in some cases where it reads (or puts back) data from the input stream.
Not quite sure how to handle put-back yet, as a count of -1 is currently ignored, so how does one count a single byte that is put back?
Easy enough to hack this in - count(1);count(-2); - but that&amp;apos;s rather messy.
