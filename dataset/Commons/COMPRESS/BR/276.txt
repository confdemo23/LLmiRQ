NullPointerException in ZipArchiveOutputStream with invalid entries
Writing raw data seems to cause problems in multiple ways, because an internal field is not set. Is this a wrong API usage?
    java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream var0 = new java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream();
    org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.jar.JarArchiveOutputStream var1 = new org.apache.commons.compress.archivers.jar.JarArchiveOutputStream((java.io.OutputStream)var0);
    var1.write(25843);
Other tests (see attachment) are very similar and cause the same problem. They can probably be ignored because the first test is the shortest one.
