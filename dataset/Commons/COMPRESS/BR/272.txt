CompressorStreamFactory fails to autodetect files using Unix compress (.Z files)
I use the factory classes quite extensively to guess the correct implementation of a file that needs to be unpacked.  The current doc does list that for lzma and 7zip files, the auto detect will not work.  I have worked around this by looking at the file extension, and hope that its correct.
For .Z files, I can only uncompress the file if I explicitly tell the factory that its using .Z compression, the auto detect never works.  I&amp;apos;m using 1.7, but I dont think its fixed in 1.8 either (after looking at the bug fix list).
Either its a bug in the doc, or in the auto detect of the compressor factory.
