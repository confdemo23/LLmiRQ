Round trip conversion with more than 66 US-ASCII characters fails when using TarArchiveOutputStream.LONGFILE_GNU
When using TarArchiveOutputStream.LONGFILE_GNU with an entry name of more than 66 US-ASCII characters, a round trip conversion (write the entry, then read it back) fails because of several bugs in TarArchiveOutputStream and TarArchiveInputStream.
This has been reported as an issue to TrueZIP, which is why you can find a more detailed analysis here: http://java.net/jira/browse/TRUEZIP-286 .
