ZipArchiveInputStream may read 0 bytes when reading from a nested Zip file
When the following code is run an error "Underlying input stream returned zero bytes" is produced. If the commented line is uncommented it can be seen that the ZipArchiveInputStream returned 0 bytes. This only happens the first time read is called, subsequent calls work as expected i.e. the following code actually works correctly with that line uncommented!
The zip file used to produce this behavious is available at http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/~dl387/test.ZIP
If this is not the correct way of processing a zip file of zip files please let me know. Also I believe whilst ZipFile can iterate over entries fast due to being able to look at the master table whilst ZipArchiveInputStream cannot. Is there anyway of instantiating a ZipFile from a zip file inside another zip file without first extracting the nested zip file?
    ZipFile zipFile = new ZipFile("C:/test.ZIP");
    for (Enumeration&lt;ZipArchiveEntry&gt; iterator = zipFile.getEntries(); iterator.hasMoreElements(); ) {
      ZipArchiveEntry entry = iterator.nextElement();
      InputStream is = new BufferedInputStream(zipFile.getInputStream(entry));
      ZipArchiveInputStream zipInput = new ZipArchiveInputStream(is);
      ZipArchiveEntry innerEntry;
      while ((innerEntry = zipInput.getNextZipEntry()) != null){
        if (innerEntry.getName().endsWith("XML"))
{

          //zipInput.read();

          System.out.println(IOUtils.toString(zipInput));

        }
      }
    }
