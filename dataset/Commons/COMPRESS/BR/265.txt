PAX headers with "strange" names can not be written
as noted by Patrik Burkhalter in COMPRESS-203 if a non-ASCII character is "7-bit-cleaned" to &amp;apos;\&amp;apos; this may lead to a file name for the PAX header that looks like a directory name to TarArchiveEntry - which leads to a bug very similar to COMPRESS-203.
