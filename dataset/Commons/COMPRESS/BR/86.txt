tar entries don&apos;t set "magic" value properly for "oldgnu" longname entries
When using the GNU longfile mode the tar classes create special archive entries containing the file name if the original name was longer than 100 characters.
Each tar entry header holds a "magic" value indicating the format.
For the special entries containing the file name the magic value should be "ustar  " indicating the "oldgnu" format.
