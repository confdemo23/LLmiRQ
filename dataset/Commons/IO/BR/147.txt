Deletion of orphaned Softlinks does not work
If there is an orphaned softlink a -&gt; b, but b does not exists anymore than the softlink will not be removed. This happens when you call FileUtils.deleteDirectory() and when the linked target b is deleted earlier than the link.
This is caused by the "ugly" file.exists() call in forceDelete()
if (!file.exists()) {
         throw new FileNotFoundException("File does not exist: " + file);
}
if this check is not done, everything works as expected. I think this test is not neccessery, cause file.delete will test this better.
Please discuss and change this.
thanx
