LineIterator should implement Iterable 
org.apache.commons.io.LineIterator does not implement Iterable.  This makes
it impossible to use in certain stylized ways, such as in a new-style for
statement.  Such use is not always desirable (it might temporarily leak a
file descriptor, until the finalizer is called), but should be possible in
situations where it is known to be acceptable.
