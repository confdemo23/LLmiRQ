org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils#waitFor waits too long
The timing algorithm is basically broken, since Thread.sleep is imprecise. There is also a counter error in the looping code. 
The following testcase will never run in less than 4 seconds on my machine
  public void testRealWallTime() 
{

        long start = System.currentTimeMillis();

        FileUtils.waitFor(new File(""), 2);

        System.out.println("elapsed = " + (System.currentTimeMillis() - start));

    }
