Subject: New AIX fix?
Hello,
I had to change the "commons-io" code to allow for usage on AIX 5.3.
Attached is the file with changes.
The long and short of the change is that the "df" command used in the
File System Utils classes requires
A "P" to be added to the switch to enable "POSIX" capability.
