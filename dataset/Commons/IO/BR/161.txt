FileCleaningTrackerTestCase hangs
The following code in FileCleaningTrackerTestCase never exits, hanging the whole compilation/testing process:
    private void waitUntilTrackCount() {
        while (theInstance.getTrackCount() != 0) {
            int total = 0;
            while (theInstance.getTrackCount() != 0) 
{
                byte[] b = new byte[1024 * 1024];
                b[0] = (byte) System.currentTimeMillis();
                total = total + b[0];
                System.gc();
            }
        }
    }
It is clear that in theory this code might loop forever, as the allocation of the byte arrays might never unleash a garbage collection complete enough to deallocate all marker objects, so to bring the track count to zero. Believe me, it&amp;apos;s not only theory .
