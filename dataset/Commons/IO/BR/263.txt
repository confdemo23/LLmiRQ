FileSystemUtils.freeSpaceKb throws exception for Windows volumes with no visible files.
Doing a FileSystemUtils.freeSpaceKb("D:/") where the drive (in this example d:) is an empty drive (A drive with no non-hidden files on it yet) results in an exception being thrown.
     "Command line returned OS error code &amp;apos;1&amp;apos; for command [cmd.exe, /C, dir /-c "D:\"]
Perhaps it could do a "dir /a /-c" to work in more cases? (Since hidden file "System Volume Information" will usually be available)
