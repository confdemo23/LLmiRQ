FileSystemUtils.freeSpaceKb doesn&apos;t work with relative paths on Linux
Calling FileSystemUtils.freeSpaceKb with ".", "./", "../", "../foo" etc. will result in an empty string being passed to df.
freeSpaceKb calls FileNameUtils.normalize on the path which destroys relative paths.
I don&amp;apos;t see any need to normalize the path so the fix is simply to remove that call.
