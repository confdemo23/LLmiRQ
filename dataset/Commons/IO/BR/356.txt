CharSequenceInputStream#reset() behaves incorrectly in case when buffer size is not dividable by data size
The size effect happens when buffer size of input stream is not dividable by requested data size. The bug is hidden in CharSequenceInputStream#reset() method which should also call (I think) bbuf.limit(0) otherwise next call to CharSequenceInputStream#read() will return the remaining tail which bbuf has accumulated.
In the attached test case the test fails, if dataSize = 13 (not dividable by 10) and runs OK if dataSize = 20 (dividable by 10).
