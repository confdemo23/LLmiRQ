FileSystemUtils needs to call Process.destroy() on exec&apos;d processes
Calling the FileSystemUtils.getFreeSpace() method multiple times (~3000) will generate an IOException with the following text: "Too many open files". Documentation from Sun says this problem is due to not destroying the java.lang.Process object returned from the System.exec() call.
Some sample code I wrote confirms that calling destroy prevents this error from occurring.
