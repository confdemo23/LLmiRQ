FilenameUtils.wildcardMatch gives incorrect results
This wildcard pattern "*?" does not match correctly. The command:
System.out.println(FilenameUtils.wildcardMatch("aaa", "*?"));
prints out "false", even though it matches. The wildcard mask is a bit unusal, but not incorrect. It should match any input with at least one character.
