Many classes are limited to length of stream < 2 GB, and behave incorrectly on larger streams
java int.MAX_VALUE is 2 GB. Classes that handle streams larger than 2 GB will behave incorrectly.
For example, see 
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/jakarta/commons/proper/io/trunk/src/java/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.java?view=markup
Method: int copy(InputStream input, OutputStream output).
The correct method would be: long copy(InputStream input, OutputStream output).
This issue may affect many classes and routines.
