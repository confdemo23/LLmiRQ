NotFileFilter documentation is incorrect
The documentation for NotFileFilter (http://commons.apache.org/io/api-release/index.html) incorrectly states that it, "Checks to see if both filters are true."  It looks to be the result of a hasty copy-and-paste from an old version of AndFileFilter (http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/commons/proper/io/trunk/src/java/org/apache/commons/io/filefilter/AndFileFilter.java?revision=140357&amp;view=markup).  It should say something like, "Returns the logical NOT of the underlying filter&amp;apos;s return value for the same arguments."
Patch is attached.
