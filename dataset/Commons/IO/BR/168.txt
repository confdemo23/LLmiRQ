Symbolic links (symlinks) followed when deleting directory.
If &amp;apos;dlink&amp;apos; is a symbolic link to a directory &amp;apos;dir&amp;apos;, and FileUtils.forceDelete is called on dlink, then here is what happens:
1) the contents of &amp;apos;dir&amp;apos; are emptied (the link is followed).
2) &amp;apos;dir&amp;apos; continues to exist (but is empty).
3) &amp;apos;dlink&amp;apos; is removed.
The correct behavior is to simply remove &amp;apos;dlink&amp;apos; without following it and thus without altering the contents of &amp;apos;dir&amp;apos; (or &amp;apos;dir&amp;apos; itself).
