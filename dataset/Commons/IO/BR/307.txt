ReaderInputStream#read(byte[] b, int off, int len) should check for valid parameters
If the buffer is null, the method should throw NPE immediately (rather than letting it occur later)
If the offset or length are &lt; 0 or would overflow the buffer, then throw IndexOutOfBoundsException with details of the values.
