Infinite loop on FileUtils.copyDirectory when the destination directory is within the source directory
When you attempt to copy a directory and the destination directory is inside the source directory an inifinite loop occurs in the copyDirectory causing Commons-IO to create a folder w/o stopping until its reaches OS limitation.
This code will recreate the bug:
FileUtils.copyDirectory(new File("C:\\temp\\test-io\\a."), new File("C:\\temp\\test-io\\a." + File.separator + new Date().getTime()));
Make sure C:\temp\test-io\a exists
