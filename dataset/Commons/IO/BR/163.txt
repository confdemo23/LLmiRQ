FileUtils.toURLs() uses deprecated (and bad) method of conversion to URL
The method FileUtils.toURLs() uses the following method to convert from File to URL:
    File.toURL();
This method has scary warnings that it&amp;apos;s a bad way to do the conversion because characters will not be escaped as required in URL strings.  In Java 1.6, this method has actually been deprecated.  All recent JDK versions recommend instead using:
    File.toURI().toURL();
as the URI code will properly perform the escaping.
