FileSystemUtils.freeSpaceKb fails to return correct size for a windows mount point
FileSystemUtils.freeSpaceKb fails to return correct result for a NTFS mount point or junction.
Suppose I have a NTFS partition mounted at C:\Data\partition1.
Now assume that the free space on Partition mounted as C: is 1GB and that mounted on "C:\Data\partition1" is 2GB. A call to FileSystemUtils.freeSpaceKb("C:\Data\partition1") will return the free space on C: and not on "C:\Data\partition1".
This is because while running the "dir /-c" with the given path, the code just retains first 2 chars i.e. for any path under "C:\blah\de\blah", "dir /-c" will be called with "C:" which will return incorrect result.
