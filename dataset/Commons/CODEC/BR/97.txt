Base64 default constructor behaviour changed to enable chunking in 1.4
The following test passes in commons-codec 1.3 but fails in 1.4:



public void testObjectEncode() throws Exception {

    Base64 b64 = new Base64();

    assertEquals("SGVsbG8gV29ybGQ=", new String(b64.encode("Hello World".getBytes())));

}



Commons-codec 1.3 returns "SGVsbG8gV29ybGQ=".
Commons-codec 1.4 returns "SGVsbG8gV29ybGQ=\r\n".
I&amp;apos;d understand if you want to close this as "Won&amp;apos;t Fix", since the behaviour wasn&amp;apos;t documented before (the constructor wasn&amp;apos;t even present!) and now it is. 
However, there is still no test for this behaviour on trunk as far as I can tell, so it would be good to add one so it doesn&amp;apos;t change again in the future. I&amp;apos;ll attach a patch for Base64Test which you can apply on trunk which will do so.
