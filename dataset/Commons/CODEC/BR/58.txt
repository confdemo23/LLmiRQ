Character set used by Base64 not documented
The Javadoc for the Base64 class does not document which character set is returned by encode() and expected by decode().
The RFC specifies "characters", not "bytes" as the result of the encoding, and yet Base64 returns bytes.
It should provide complete information as to how to convert these bytes to and from Strings. I assume the character set used is ASCII, but that should be made explicit in the Javadoc.
