HmacUtils.updateHmac calls reset() unnecessarily
The HmacUtils.updateHmac() methods call reset().
This means that it&amp;apos;s not possible to build up a digest using multiple such calls.
The only useful operation that can be performed afterwards is to call one of the Mac.doFinal() methods.
Unfortunately it&amp;apos;s probably too late to change this.
However it should at least be documented.
