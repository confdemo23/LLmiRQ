DigestUtils: add APIs named after standard alg name SHA-1
DigestUtils already has SHA APIs but they use the "SHA" algorithm name which is not on the standard name list here: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/StandardNames.html. 
SHA-1 is on the list though, so use that for SHA-1 APIs.
