activemq-camel - This feature is not listed as installed out of the box in the full-esb
Run this command






features:list -i






To show installed features. Notice that the activemq-camel feature is not installed. Instead there is a camel-activemq which is from SMX
installed  ] [4.5.0.fuse-71-036 ] camel-activemq           servicemix-4.5.0.fuse-71-036
Then I install the correct feature






features:install activemq-camel 






And list all the features again






features:list -i






And now we have both






[installed  ] [4.5.0.fuse-71-036 ] camel-activemq           servicemix-4.5.0.fuse-71-036       




[installed  ] [5.7.0.fuse-71-036 ] activemq                 activemq-5.7.0.fuse-71-036         




[installed  ] [5.7.0.fuse-71-036 ] activemq-spring          activemq-5.7.0.fuse-71-036         




[installed  ] [5.7.0.fuse-71-036 ] activemq-blueprint       activemq-5.7.0.fuse-71-036         




[installed  ] [5.7.0.fuse-71-036 ] activemq-camel           activemq-5.7.0.fuse-71-036     






I am not sure if that camel-activemq feature should be installed?
At least the activemq-camel should be, as that&amp;apos;s the correct feature for integrating ActiveMQ and Camel.
