Cannot visualize child container info from hawtio
Using jboss-fuse-6.1.0.redhat-114, when we try to create a container with profile jboss-medium, jboss-full .... then the following error appears on the screen (Hawtio) even if the container is well created :
JBossFuse:karaf@root&gt; fabric:container-create-child --profile jboss-fuse-full root demo
Jmx Login for root: admin
Jmx Password for root: 
The following containers have been created successfully:
	Container: demo.
JBossFuse:karaf@root&gt; fabric:container-list
[id] [version] [alive] [profiles] [provision status]
