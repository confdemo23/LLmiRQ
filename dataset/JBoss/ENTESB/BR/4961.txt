Fuse and A-MQ both have the amq:(esb:)check-for-user and amq:(esb:)create-admin-user
IMHO Fuse should just contain: esb:create-admin-user esb:check-for-user and A-MQ should just contain: amq:create-admin-user amq:check-for-user






JBossA-MQ:karaf@root&gt; esb:check-for-user




No user found in etc/users.properties. Please use the &amp;apos;esb:create-admin-user&amp;apos;




command to create one.












JBossFuse:karaf@root&gt; amq:create-admin-user 




No user specified. Some features may not be accessible.
