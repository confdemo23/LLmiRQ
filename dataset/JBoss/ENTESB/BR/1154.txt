Create dummy patch jars to test patch
Hi, 
WE need to create some sort of test jars to test the patching capabilities of 6.1.  The following areas should be covered:
1. Fabric container
2. Non-fabric container
I don&amp;apos;t think this needs to be fancy. I&amp;apos;m thinking of some  jars that when installed/started  print a message to the log which we can grep. Hopefully we can automate part of the test. Probably best to do some checks in Fabric itself, MQ, Camel.
