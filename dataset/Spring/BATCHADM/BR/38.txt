Job configuration upload overwrites all existing jobs
Job configuration upload either overwrites existing jobs or throws duplicate job exception (depending on whether we choose to reload() or load() it in the JobLoader).  There is no way to identify the Resource that is being loaded, so any resource coming from an upload is treated equally.  Might be tough to fix in general, but at least something with the original filename might be do-able.
