Wrong StepExecutions displayed for partitioned jobs
When going to the details page of a JobExecution (/jobs/executions/15610) a lot of StepExecutions are displayed that don&amp;apos;t belong to the JobExecution. In the JobExecutionController for some reason all step names for the Job are collected and then listed as StepExecutions. For partitioned jobs step names are created automatically with a suffix (:partitionx). So currently I see a StepExecution displayed for every step name that has been created before in any job.
I deleted the part from the details - method in the JobExecutionController that adds StepExecutionInfo objects for those step names, and everything is fine.
