MySQL timestamps have 1s resolution so no use for pagination in concurrent environment
The integration tests (ignored) fail in an obvious way for any paged query.  Maybe we could make MySQL a special case (yuck), but even then it&amp;apos;s not clear what the correct field is to order by since ids are not monotonic in a cluster / group of application nodes.  Maybe MySQL will only ever work if jobs are launched non-concurrently and/or from command line?
