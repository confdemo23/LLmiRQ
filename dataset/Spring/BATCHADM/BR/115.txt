SimpleJobMetrics.getLatestStepExitDescription() doesn&apos;t work if the last step is very quick.
I&amp;apos;ve found (running against MySQL  and derby) that the timestamp comparison of steps isn&amp;apos;t granular enough when the step executions are close together (within same second I think).  Adding another test comparing id&amp;apos;s did the trick for me:
eg:
if (stepDate.after(latest)) {
    latest = stepDate;
    stepExecution = candidate;
    // hack when stepExecution endTimes are not granular enough.
} else if (stepDate.equals(latest) &amp;&amp; candidate.getId() &gt; stepExecution.getId()) {
    latest = stepDate;
    stepExecution = candidate;
}
