AbstractConnectionFactory.setAddresses(String) should ignore empty string
At the moment if an empty string is passed it is parsed to an array with size 1 and empty host in Address (due to use of the String.split() method), which makes java connecting to localhost.
This is completely unexpected.
I&amp;apos;ve raised this question in rabbitmq-java-client https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rabbitmq-users/yIMnrcR9_o4 and throwing an exception is a possible option there.
I would suggest a hasText() check before in spring-amqp code.
