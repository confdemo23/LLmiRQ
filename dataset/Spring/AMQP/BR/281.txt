AmqpAppender is causing the application not to shut down
if the logging is configured to use AmqpAppender the thread remains alive and does not shut down if the application is started from a main method and if it is a web app then the classloader will not unload on hot redeploy and tomcat shows the following message :
The web application [/xxx] appears to have started a thread named [log-event-retry-delay] but has failed to stop it. This is very likely to create a memory leak.
