Early Exit Queue Declaration on a Connection Reset
Related to AMQP-470.
In the SimpleMessageListenerContainer, passive queue declaration is retried after IO errors. It should only do so if the declaration fails due to a missing queue. We should take an early exit for other IO errors (such as connection reset).
Eventually after retries are exhausted, a QueuesNotAvailableException which is a FatalListenerStartupException is thrown.
