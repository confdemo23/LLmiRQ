RabbitMessagingTemplate doesn&apos;t take advantage of RabbitTemplate&apos;s registered converters
When using RabbitTemplate in a Spring Boot application, it&amp;apos;s very easy to register a Spring AMQP Message Converter. Just add this to your code:






@Bean




Jackson2JsonMessageConverter jackson2JsonMessageConverter() {




	return new Jackson2JsonMessageConverter();




}






However, if you switch to RabbitMessagingTemplate, that bean no longer works, because RabbitMessagingTemplate doesn&amp;apos;t offer to look up RabbitTemplate&amp;apos;s converters, and instead relies on its own. Looking inside Spring Boot, there doesn&amp;apos;t appear to be any wiring that offers to hook up message converters either.
