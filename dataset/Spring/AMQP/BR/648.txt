Container Fails to Recover
Container configured to listen on multiple queues.
Delete a queue, suspend the consumer thread in handleCancel.
Stop/start the broker.
The issue is that we detect there are other queues so we attempt to cancel those consumers (basicCacncel) but we&amp;apos;ll never get a handleCancelOk call because the broker had been restarted.
When we cancel the other consumers, we need to properly deal with failure to cancel.
