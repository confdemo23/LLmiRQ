Normal closes are logged as error
The following errors are logged during connection shutdown:






2015-04-09 13:34:47 CachingConnectionFactory       ERROR Channel shutdown: clean connection shutdown; protocol method: #method&lt;connection.close&gt;(reply-code=200, reply-text=OK, class-id=0, method-id=0)






It seems to me that org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.connection.RabbitUtils.isNormalChannelClose() returns false here because the shutdown reason is connection.close, not channel.close.
