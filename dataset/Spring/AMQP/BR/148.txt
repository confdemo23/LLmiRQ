Default number of consumers is 0 on SimpleMessageListenerContainer if afterPropertiesSet() not called
SimpleMessageListenerContainer has a default number of concurrent consumers set to 0, and the validateConfiguration() method, which checks for it and eventually set it to 1, seems to be never called.
This is very annoying, because applications using older versions will stop working with no apparent reason.
Finally, please note that version M2 had a default number set to 1.
