Bindings are not re-established after re-creating anonymous queues
Whilst testing bug report AMQP-373
Stopping and starting a listener container creates the queue
However the bindings are not re-established when the queue is created for the second time hence, no messages can be routed to the queue.
Additionally heading off a potential future bug (before it happens):
Assuming that the listener-container is set to autoStart="false".
There is a discrepancy between the first and second start.
On the first start the binding will already exist, hence there "may" be messages in the queue when the container is manually started.
However on the second start the queue isn&amp;apos;t created until the container is re-started (hence there are never any messages pending).
I can see how people may prefer either the first or second behavior depending on their use-case, however I doubt anyone would want both.
