LiteDeviceResolver does not see IPAD user-agent as mobile.
I have been testing using Firefox user-agent switcher to simulate the IPAD.
Mozilla/5.0 (iPad; U; CPU OS 3_2 like Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/531.21.10 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0.4 Mobile/7B334b Safari/531.21.10
This is seen by the LiteDeviceResolver as &amp;apos;not mobile&amp;apos;.
In the forum discussion referenced it is believed this is not correct.
