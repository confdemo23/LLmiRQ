SiteSwitcherRequestFilter - filterChain.doFilter should only be called if the response is not already committed
In doFilterInternal(...) the call to the filterChain should only be executed, if the response is not already committed - i.e. the SiteSwitcherHandler did not handle the response.
Possible fix:






@Override




protected void doFilterInternal(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, FilterChain filterChain)




			throws ServletException, IOException {




	if(siteSwitcherHandler.handleSiteSwitch(request, response)) {




			filterChain.doFilter(request, response);




	}




}
