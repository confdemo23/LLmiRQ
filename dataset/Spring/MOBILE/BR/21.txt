False positives in LiteDeviceResolver
I&amp;apos;m getting a false positive from a request via the Layar app (www.layar.com). The app sends a request from an android device with the following user-agent: "Layar/4.0 Android/2.2.1".
Would it be somehow possible to create a list of prefixes which must not be in the user-agent?
