OpenId integration and support for discovering relying parties
Hi,
I am using the excellent openId support in Spring Security but I noticed that with Yahoo, I keep seeing the following message on Yahoo&amp;apos;s openid page:
"Warning: This website has not confirmed its identity with Yahoo! and might be fraudulent. Do not share any personal information with this website unless you are certain it is legitimate. "
I looked into this issue and found that  the reason is that Yahoo implements a feature in OpenId 2.0 where it verifies if the return_to URL is a relying party endpoint (see http://openid.net/specs/openid-authentication-2_0-12.html#realms, section 9.2.1). In this case the return_to URL is http://&lt;website&gt;/j_spring_openid_security_check.
I also followed the tutorial here http://blog.nerdbank.net/2008/06/why-yahoo-says-your-openid-site.html but with no success. 
I can actually see on my webserver log a Yahoo IP address hitting the following URL after I post the OpenId authentication request:
68.142.241.108 - - [15/Jul/2008:02:49:06 +0000] "GET /j_spring_openid_security_check HTTP/1.1" 302 -
after which Yahoo&amp;apos;s openId page shows the warning. Note that the login works fine if I click on the "Let me in" button.
Please help.
