Improve JaasNameCallbackHandler handling of string 
I submitted this via the listserv on 7/21/2005, and one of the developers said it would be looked into immediately, so I didnt file a JIRA issue on it, but since it apparently hasn&amp;apos;t been touched in CVS, I&amp;apos;m going to submit it here.  I&amp;apos;m pasting in the email contents below:
I&amp;apos;m also going to submit a patch, which is my version of the fix.
================================
I&amp;apos;ll double check but I&amp;apos;m pretty sure that&amp;apos;s a bug. If so I&amp;apos;ll get it committed either tonight or tomorrow. US time that is  -Ray

&gt; I was tracking down some issues that came up after we started using our own
&gt; UserDetails object in the principal of Authentication.    This method in
&gt; JaasNameCallbackHandler seems to be calling the incorrect method.  In 
&gt; AbstractAuthenticationHandler, the methods called are 
&gt; &amp;apos;authentication.getPrincipal().getUsername()&amp;apos;  not
&gt; &amp;apos;toString()&amp;apos;  like it appears below.   Is there any reason for this?  The
&gt; problem we are facing is that our JAAS handler is trying to 
&gt; authenticate on the entire toString() output of our UserDetails 
&gt; object, instead of just the username, at this point, when the Acegi 
&gt; API/source seems to indicate that
&gt; toString() is to be used for debug output.  
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; 
&gt;     public void handle(Callback callback, Authentication 
&gt; authentication)
&gt; 
&gt;         throws IOException, UnsupportedCallbackException {
&gt; 
&gt;         if (callback instanceof NameCallback) 
{
&gt; 
&gt;             NameCallback ncb = (NameCallback) callback;
&gt; 
&gt;             ncb.setName(authentication.getPrincipal().toString());
&gt; 
&gt;         }
&gt; 
&gt;     }
