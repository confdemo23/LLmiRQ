Java configuration missing hasAnyRole
Java configuration for restricting access to a URI has methods hasAuthority, hasAnyAuthority, and hasRole. It is missing hasAnyRole. This is not a big deal since you can work around it with hasAnyAuthority, but it&amp;apos;s still not consistent with using string expressions in access or annotations.
