Absolute URL redirection may cause problems in load-balanced environments
When re-directing a non-authenticated user, class AuthenticationProcessingFilterEntryPoint builds an absolute URL. 
This is designed this way becuase it may need to replace the protocol (http to https).
In Load-Balanced environments this may lead to loss of the load balancer, as the redirection will use the server as part of the URL. Load balancers / app servers have settings to avoid this, but these entail special configuration and may limit other applications on same server.
Use of relative redirection is much better for most scenarios.
