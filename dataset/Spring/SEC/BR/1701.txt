OpenId identifier should be trimmed
The authentication fails if a user copy&amp;pastes his OpenId identity and it includes a white sprace at the end.
An additional space is often append by copy it from hmtl pages or emails.
I&amp;apos;ve got this problem with 3.0.4, but I&amp;apos;m sure all other versions are also affected.
Fix would look like this at OpenIDAuthenticationFilter.attemptAuthentication():
String identity = request.getParameter("openid.identity");
if (!StringUtils.hasText(identity)) {
       identity = identity.trim(); // FIX
       String claimedIdentity = obtainUsername(request);
Stracktrace:
org.springframework.security.authentication.AuthenticationServiceException: Unable to process claimed identity &amp;apos;http://alice-franz.myopenid.com/ &amp;apos;
