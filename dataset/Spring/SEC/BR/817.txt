NPE in org.springframework.security.config.FilterChainProxyPostProcessor
The NPE occurs in the method "FilterChainProxyPostProcessor.postProcessBeforeInitialization" when the beanName argument is null. In my case this argument is null when using beans that are configured using the @Configurable annotation and the AspectJ AnnotationBeanConfigurerAspect.
I also noticed that this NPE might happen in the other BeanPostProcessor implementations in spring-security. An easy fix would be to change the order of operands in the string comparison: beanName.equals(BeanIds.FILTER_CHAIN_PROXY) =&gt; BeanIds.FILTER_CHAIN_PROXY.equals(beanName)
