Spring security version check reports incorrectly.
When using spring core version 3.2.10 or greater the spring security version check reports a warning message about minimum version incorrectly.
To recreate run spring core 3.2.11 with spring security 3.2.4.
The issue is in the compare statement of:






if (springVersion.compareTo(MIN_SPRING_VERSION) &lt; 0) {




     logger.warn("**** You are advised to use Spring " + MIN_SPRING_VERSION +  " or later with this version. You are running: " + springVersion);




}
