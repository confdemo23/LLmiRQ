CsrfFilter JavaDoc incomplete and session less token repository appreciated 
The Java Doc for CsrfFilter says:
Typically the CsrfTokenRepository implementation chooses to store the CsrfToken in HttpSession with HttpSessionCsrfTokenRepository. This is preferred to storing the token in a cookie which. "
That last part does not look like a sentence .
It would also be great to have a CsrfTokenRepository implementation not based on a servlet container session to allow for stateless web apps.
