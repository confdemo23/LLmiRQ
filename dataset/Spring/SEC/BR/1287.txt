Regression with fix SEC-1022 - cannot register custom permissions w/BasicLookupStrategy
With the fix for SEC-1002 in 3.0RC1 and the removal of the static methods in BasePermission, unfortunately it is now impossible to use BasicLookupStrategy with custom permissions. This is because the PermissionFactory member of BasicLookupStrategy is private, with no accessor and no setter or constructor injection possible. While this wasn&amp;apos;t available in prior versions of 3.0 either, at least in prior versions you could use the static methods to register permissions.
Can you expose the PermissionFactory member on BasicLookupStrategy, either through an overloaded constructor or setter?
