RememberMeAuthenticationToken throws IllegalArgumentException on empty authorities list
When a user is authenticated via remember me, in RememberMeAuthenticationToken:56 (called from TokenBasedRememberMeServices:190) an IllegalArgumentException is thrown if the user object has no authorities granted. This is inconsistent with other authentication schemes which allow authentications without granted authorities. I can&amp;apos;t see any reason for throwing an exception in this case, because nothing is wrong with a user who is signed in and gets no authorities granted.
