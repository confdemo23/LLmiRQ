GlobalMethodSecurityConfiguration&apos;s DefaultWebSecurityExpressionHandler has null BeanResolver

this blog post got me started with java config, and everything worked fine until i tried to use @PreAuthorize annotation that uses my custom authentication service (via @myCustomService) expression. I get an error that
No bean resolver registered in the context to resolve access to bean myCustomService
Looking at M2 and RC1 source code, it seems that when WebSecurity is created in WebSecurityConfiguration and the default DefaultWebSecurityExpressionHandler is used and it has no BeanResolver set (from AbstractSecurityExpressionHandler).
Might this be a bug in the java based configuration?
