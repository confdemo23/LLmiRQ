JdbcExtendedDaoImpl doesn&apos;t work with Postgres
Using JdbcExtendedDaoImpl together with PostgreSQL and the following acl tables fails when inserting new identities or permissions:
create table acl_object_identity (
     id serial primary key,
     object_identity varchar(250) not null unique,
     parent_object integer references acl_object_identity,
     acl_class varchar(250) not null
);
create table acl_permission (
     id serial primary key,
     acl_object_identity integer not null references acl_object_identity(id),
     recipient varchar(100) not null,
     mask integer not null,
     constraint unique_recipient unique(acl_object_identity, recipient)
);
This is due to the fact that JdbcExtendedDaoImpl explicitly sets the id to null. Postgres will naturally give an error as this is a primary key and thus cannot be null. Either set it to the value you want or leave it out of the statement.
It doesn&amp;apos;t seem to be possible to override this by injecting new sql statements for AclObjectIdentityInsertStatement and AclPermissionInsertStatement. AclObjectIdentityInsert and AclPermissionInsert classes declares four parameters, the first of which is hardcoded to null.
