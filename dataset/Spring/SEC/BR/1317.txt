Http configuration with no internal AuthenticationProviders causes Exception
The the internal ProviderManager, which is created by the &lt;http&gt; namespace element (SEC-1195), fails if it has no providers. Either a null provider should be added if the provider list is empty or the use of an internal instance should be skipped completely.
