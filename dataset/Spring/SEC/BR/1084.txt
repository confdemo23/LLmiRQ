Retain Authentication.details when authenticating in LdapAuthenticationProvider
It seems that the LdapAuthenticationProvider looses any details set on the incomming Authentication.details property. Several other AuthenticationProviders retain these details
Unless of course this is intentional it should be trivial to improve this with simply copying the details, thus making them available to the application. 
Simple suggestion attached as patch.
