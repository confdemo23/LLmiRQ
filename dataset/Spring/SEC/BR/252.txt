AbstractAuthenticationToken NullPointerException
On line 144 in method getName() the return statement produces a NullPointerException when trying to use X509 Authenticaito.  Whenever doFilter in X509ProcessingFilter is called and I do not have a certificate in the request (i.e. I am not on SSL) this code throws a NullPointerException which then causes a site error.
public String getName() {
        if (this.getPrincipal() instanceof UserDetails) 
{
            return ((UserDetails) this.getPrincipal()).getUsername();
        }

        return this.getPrincipal().toString(); 
    }
If the return statement is changed to check if the principal is null first we no longer have this issue. Example: return this.getPrincipal() == null ? "" : this.getPrincipal().toString();
Also, I have security degrade to LDAP with a form entry point for users that do not have a certificate set up.  As you can imagine this also produces a NullPointerException because there is no certificate.
