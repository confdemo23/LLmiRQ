x509 authentication does not work properly
x509 authentication does not work properly
I have an application with x509 authentication configured.
First:
In RC1 release my application startup properly. In final 2.0.0 release this exception occur:
org.springframework.beans.factory.parsing.BeanDefinitionParsingException: Configuration problem: No AuthenticationEntryPoint could be established.
If I write the entry point bean like this:
&lt;bean id="x509EntryPoint" class="org.springframework.security.ui.x509.X509ProcessingFilterEntryPoint" /&gt;
everything work properly.
I think 2.0.0 should work automatic like RC1 "OR" x509 documentation section in the reference manual should document it.
Second:
When I do the first login with x509 certificate in my application, a 403 http status code occurs.
This happens only if a http-&gt;https redirection is needed. 
Example:
First page is "IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY" and HTTP. Then user goes to a secure page over HTTPS.
The browser dialog appers to select the certificate. Then a 403 occur.
If the first page is HTTPS everything work properly.
I will attach the applicationContext and the error log.
Sorry for my bad english.
