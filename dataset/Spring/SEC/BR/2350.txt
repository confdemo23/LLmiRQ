Warning when using 3.2.0.RC2 with Spring Framework 4.0
When starting an application running Spring Framework 4.0 and Spring Security 3.2.0.RC2, the following message is logged:
12:19:08.129 [localhost-startStop-1]   WARN  org.springframework.security.core.SpringSecurityCoreVersion org.springframework.security.core.SpringSecurityCoreVersion.performVersionChecks(SpringSecurityCoreVersion.java:53): *** Spring Major version &amp;apos;3&amp;apos; expected, but you are running with version: 4.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT. Please check your classpath for unwanted jar files.
Spring Security should certainly warn if Spring Framework is older than supported, but it should not warn if Spring Framework is newer that expected. At the very least, 3.2.0 should support Spring Framework 4.
