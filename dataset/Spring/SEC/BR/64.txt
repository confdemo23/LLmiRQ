FilterChainProxy does not work on Orion Web Application Server
Setting up the contacts example on Orion does not work out of the box.
This is because of a bug/feature in Orion where the &amp;apos;getServletPath&amp;apos; method returns null when called from within a filter.  The FilterInvocation class makes use of this method and therefore fails to do the redirects to the &amp;apos;j_acegi_security_check&amp;apos;.  Everything works fine if you configure Acegi longhand via the web.xml.
I realise this is more of a bug with Orion (and I have raised it with them) but it would be good if you guys could put a workaround into the framework.  In my investigations I got it work by putting something similar to the following in the &amp;apos;getRequestUrl()&amp;apos; method of FilterInvocation, but I obviously havn&amp;apos;t done a full impact analysis of this change.
 String uri = request.getServletPath();
    if (uri == null) 
{
      uri = request.getRequestURI();
      uri = uri.substring(request.getContextPath().length());
    }

Thanks
