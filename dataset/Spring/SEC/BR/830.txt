SavedRequestAwareWrapper and ParameterMethodNameResolver
This is a very simple use case, Its strange how this was ignored. I will try to create a sample war file and get it. in the mean while..
Spring : 2.5.1 (code in 2.0)
Acegi : 1.0.4
lest say we have Acegi security and a multi action controller method resolved on "action" parameter.
lets say, we try to access
/mod/order.html?action=view
and acegi saves the request into SavedRequestAwareWrapper and forwards to /login.html
After login, it goes to OrderController.view() method and forwards to view.jsp
similarly
/mod/order.html?action=viewDetail (This has more logic and data building)
to OrderController.viewDetail() to viewdetail.jsp
This is fine so far
but I have a condition in view.jsp (say for certain cust)
if (cust priv &gt; ordinary) 
 &lt;jsp:include page="/mod/order.html?action=viewDetail" /&gt;
now, if i add this jsp include, and access this page with a customer satisfying the condition, a new request to
/mod/order.html?action=view
keeps looping after login and there is a stack over flow.
Reason:
After Login, the request /mod/order.html?action=view goes to call the 
OrderController.view(), once it dispatches to jsp, the jsp include is kicked off, and the method resolver tries to get the parameter action from the request. However, the SavedRequestAwareWrapper.getParameter returns it from the savedRequest which is "/mod/order.html?action=view" .. it keeps looping there. 
I am eager to find out how you would solve this.
