NoSuchMethodException in AuthenticationTag
There&amp;apos;s a problem with a property not found in case of custom UserDetails implementation if this property is defined in a superclass.
The solution is to change getDeclaredMethod() call to getMethod() which searches also the superclass if no matching method&amp;apos;s found in the specified class (patch provided).
