Exception when using AbstractSecurityWebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer with anonymous authentication
When using an AbstractSecurityWebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer and trying to use messaging with an anonymous authentication (i.e. not logged in), i see the following exception:






org.springframework.messaging.MessageDeliveryException: Failed to send message to ExecutorSubscribableChannel[clientInboundChannel];




nested exception is org.springframework.security.authentication.AuthenticationCredentialsNotFoundException: An Authentication object was not found in the SecurityContext






thrown here: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/access/intercept/AbstractSecurityInterceptor.java#L200
a wild guess would be that an anonymous authentication is not put into the message headers, so the SecurityContextChannelInterceptor does not populate the SecurityContext and then again AbstractSecurityInterceptor just gets null instead of an anonymous Authentication.
but i am sure you got a better idea whats going on there (or if i am just missing sth.) 
thanks, zyro
