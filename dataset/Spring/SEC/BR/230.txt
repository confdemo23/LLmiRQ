ExceptionTranslationFilter does not catch AccessDeniedException with Spring MVC M2/M3
I am writing a SpringMVC-based web application with Acegi Security.  I have a Spring Controller object that invokes a method that is protected by an Acegi MethodSecurityInterceptor.  When the MethodSecurityInterceptor throws an AccessDeniedException, it is getting wrapped by the Spring FrameworkServlet in a org.springframework.web.util.NestedServletException.  Because of this wrapping, the ExceptionTranslationFilter never catches an AccessDeniedException, thus causing a 500 server error to bubble up instead of a 403/redirect to authenticationEntryPoint. 
I&amp;apos;m not sure whose problem this is - the Acegi code could inspect the root cause of the NestedServletException, or the FrameworkServlet could pass on RuntimeExceptions without wrapping.
