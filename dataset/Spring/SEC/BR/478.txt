Incorrect decoding of base64 cookie value by TokenBasedRememberMeServices.autoLogin
This bug can be observed by using the contact example application and trying to login with dianne/emu while using the "remember me option". This user mght not be remembered, as it is the case for other users. this, however, might not be reproductible under certain conditions.
The heart of the problem is that a user will not be remembered if the resulting base64 encoded value stored in in cookie has a number of significant caracters that is not an exact multiple of 4. In such condition, according to thee base64 specification, the value is padded with trailing "=". The result is a cookie value padded with "%3D", which is ok.
When the cookie value is retrieved by the autoLogin method, the trailing "=" are lost. Although on might think this should be detected by Base64.Base64.isArrayByteBase64(), it is not because this method returns true if the value contains only valid character, even if the value itself is not valid.
Workaround :
A simple workaround is to add the missing trailing "=" to the retrieved value, which can be done with the following code :
  public Authentication autoLogin(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {
    Cookie[] cookies = request.getCookies();
    if ((cookies == null) || (cookies.length == 0)) 
{
      return null;
    }

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; cookies.length; i++) {
      if (ACEGI_SECURITY_HASHED_REMEMBER_ME_COOKIE_KEY.equals(cookies[i].getName())) {
        String cookieValue = cookies[i].getValue();
        /*************************
          PATCH BEGINS HERE
         *************************/
        for (int j = 0; j &lt; cookieValue.length() % 4; j++) 
{
          cookieValue = cookieValue + "=";
        }
        /************************
        PATCH ENDS HERE
        *************************/
        if (Base64.isArrayByteBase64(cookieValue.getBytes())) {
          if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) 
{
            logger.debug("Remember-me cookie detected");
          }

Fix: 
The real fix would probably concern either Base64.decodeBase64 or Cookie.getValue
