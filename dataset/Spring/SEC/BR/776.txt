Http Session created for Anonymous request
I&amp;apos;m using Anonymous Authentication for the public pages on a site I&amp;apos;m developing. If I go to a page that is successful an anonymous authentication token is made and the reset by the AnonymousProcessingFilter so that no HttpSession is created for that request. However, if the page I go to results in an error (like 404 or 500) an HttpSession is created with the anonymous authentication token saved within.
I think that it is because the HttpSessionContextIntegrationFilter wraps the response so that it can try and save the context on sendError/sendRedirect calls, however the AnonymousProcessingFilter isn&amp;apos;t given a chance to remove the anonymous authentication token, the result is that a session is created.
