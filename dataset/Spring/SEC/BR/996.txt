AccessDeniedhandlerimpl  doesn&apos;t write response code if used with errorPage
The forward to the error page will cause the response to be committed and thus the 403 error code cannot be written (the commit check was introduced as a fix for SEC-324), but the code should perhaps be written before the forward instead.
