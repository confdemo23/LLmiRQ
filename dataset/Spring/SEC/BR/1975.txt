AuthenticationSimpleHttpInvokerRequestExecutor and AnonymousAuthenticationToken
Hi,
I am working with AuthenticationSimpleHttpInvokerRequestExecutor to add http basic authentication to HTTPInvoker requests. When using the AnonymousAuthenticationFilter to create an AnonymousAuthenticationToken the request executor will extract "anonymousUser" and some randomly generated credentials. In the backend, I have no chance to generate meaningful UserDetails for "anonymousUser".
So wouldn&amp;apos;t it be better to check in prepareConnection() if the Authentication is a UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken, since these are anyway the only usable tokens for http basic authentication?
