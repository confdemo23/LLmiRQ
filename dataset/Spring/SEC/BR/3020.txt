HttpServletRequest.isUserInRole("ROLE_<anything>") returns false with defaults
I&amp;apos;m just trying to upgrade from Spring Security 3.1 to 4.0.1 and have discovered a breaking change in the behaviour of request.isUserInRole().
In Spring 3.1 the following was returning true and now returns false:
request.isUserInRole("ROLE_REMEMBER_ME")
In Spring 4.0.1 I had to change it to the following:
request.isUserInRole("REMEMBER_ME")
