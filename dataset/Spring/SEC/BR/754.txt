Wrong byte array lenght used in Md4PasswordEncoder#encodePassword
Part of patch for bug #SEC-728 has been incorrectly applied.
The line
md4.update(passBytes, 0, saltedPass.length());
should read
md4.update(passBytes, 0, passBytes.length());
The current (2.0RC1) version is incorrect, since the number of chars in an UTF-8 string is generally NOT equal to it number of bytes!
