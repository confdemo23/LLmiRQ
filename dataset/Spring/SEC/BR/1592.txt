CAS proxy receptor requests must not pass through the filter chain
I configured spring-security-cas in my webapp for generating proxy tickets.
During ticket validation we provide a pgtUrl parameter and then the CAS server tries
to connect to our webapp (using the configured proxyReceptorUrl) to determine is this
URL is a valid end-point but it result in a 404 because the request is passed trough
the servlet but is not handled (because no controller is mapped for this URL).
If we set the grails.plugins.springsecurity.rejectIfNoRule parameter [1] to true or if I mark this
proxy receptor URL with the role "IS_AUTHENTICATED_REMEMBERED" then it works:

the ping request [2] result in a 302 (redirection to CAS because the request needs to be authenticated)
the pgtId/pgtIou request result also in a 302 (therefore without the proper XML fragment) but the mapping is stored

This works because the CAS server is not strict about the expected XML fragment,
only the a proper status code is mandatory [2].
Current workaround is to create a controller for this URL with anonymous access and
always respond with a 200 and some text.
I believe this issue is not related to Grails and may impact any webapp using
spring-security-cas and wanting to generate proxy tickets.
Furthermore, the default behaviour in cas-client [3] is already to stop processing the
request once it has been handled by the Cas20ProxyReceivingTicketValidationFilter [3].
