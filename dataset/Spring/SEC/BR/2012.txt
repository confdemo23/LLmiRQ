Javadoc for UserDetails.getPassword() says that the password is never null; however it may be
The Javadoc for org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.UserDetails.getPassword() says:






Returns the password used to authenticate the user. Cannot return null.









Returns:




the password (never null)






However, if the concrete implementation of UserDetails also implements org.springframework.security.core.CredentialsContainer (and this is the case for org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.User, for instance), then the password may actually be null if the credentials have been deleted by a call to org.springframework.security.core.CredentialsContainer.eraseCredentials(). See org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.User.eraseCredentials(), for instance.
