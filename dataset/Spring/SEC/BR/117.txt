JdbcDaoImpl not properly extensible
While the javadoc for JdbcDaoImpl suggests that it is possible to override the initMappingSqlQueries() if the default strategy for customizing the SQL queries doesn&amp;apos;t provide enough flexibility, this is in fact impossible because authoritiesByUsernameMapping and usersByUsernameMapping are declared private while they should be protected.
This as far as I can see prevents using this class against an Oracle database that doesn&amp;apos;t support boolean fields.
