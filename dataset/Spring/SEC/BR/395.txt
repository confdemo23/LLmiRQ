HttpSessionEventPublisher causes a NullPointerException
As explained in...
http://forum.springframework.org/showthread.php?t=30766
The code naively assumes that one intance of the HttpSessionEventPublisher will be created by the container. In Websphere 5.1.1 at least, this is not true.
The code will be modified to get the ApplicationContext in an as needed basis rather than storing it in a field.
