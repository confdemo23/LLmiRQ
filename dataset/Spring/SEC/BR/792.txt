Filters should only be added to the default stack if they are labelled using custom-filter.
At the moment FilterChainProxyPostProcessor is adding any filters whose class names begin with org.springframework.security. A user may have a separate FilterChainProxy configured with different filters and these shouldn&amp;apos;t be added to the namespace instance. The list of filter beans should be registered independently and added to by custom-filter and the namespace parser. This separate list should be used for the final configuration of the namespace FilterChainProxy instance.
