Add Secure/InsecureChannelProcessor supporting attribute
Most of my URLs fall into two categories: require security (REQUIRES_SECURE_CHANNEL) or require insecure (REQUIRES_INSECURE_CHANNEL). But I have a couple links which must support both HTTP/HTTPS and there is no way for me to express this exception. I recommend two new attributes:
SUPPORTS_INSECURE_CHANNEL
SUPPORTS_SECURE_CHANNEL
Then I can write my bean as follows:
&lt;property name="filterInvocationDefinitionSource"&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;
    CONVERT_URL_TO_LOWERCASE_BEFORE_COMPARISON 
    \A/secure/.*\Z=REQUIRES_SECURE_CHANNEL 
    \A/myspecialcase/*\Z=SUPPORTS_SECURE_CHANNEL
    \A.*\Z=REQUIRES_INSECURE_CHANNEL
  &lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
