SavedRequest parameters are treated as case-insensitive
The DefaultSavedRequest stores parameters in a case-insensitive TreeMap, but with a normal HttpServletRequest parameter names are case-sensitive.
Basically, this TreeMap should not use a case-insensitive comparator: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/c79bceab03555df0825b5d0c96fc9bc38eb88b9a/web/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/web/savedrequest/DefaultSavedRequest.java#L65
Someone already noticed this mistake in the past, see the comment at the test class: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/c79bceab03555df0825b5d0c96fc9bc38eb88b9a/web/src/test/java/org/springframework/security/web/savedrequest/DefaultSavedRequestTests.java#L35
Header names should be case-insensitive, so that&amp;apos;s fine.
