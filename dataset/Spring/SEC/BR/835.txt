SEC-790 changes incompatible with J2EE 1.3
The changes made for issue SEC-790 break the DefaultLoginPageGeneratingFilter under J2EE 1.3.  Line 79 in DefaultLoginPageGeneratingFilter uses the setCharacterEncoding method, which was introduced in J2EE 1.4.  The same thing can be accomplished with the setContentType method instead, with response.setContentType("text/html; charset=utf-8").
