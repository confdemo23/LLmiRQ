AclFormattingUtils.printBinary does not handle negative
When printBinary in invoked with negative argument i it will either throw StringIndexOutOfBoundsException or return wrong result. All versions are affected.
Problem is in Integer.toString(i, 2) which is prepending minus sign in the front of the string for negative numbers.
Solution is to replace that call by Integer.toBinaryString
Attached are diff with patch and two simple tests that are failing with current implementation.
