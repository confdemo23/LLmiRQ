Malformed Base64 in Basic Authentication header causes BasicAuthenticationFilter to throw a RuntimeException

Since Base64.decode throws a RuntimeException if it detects bad characters in the input string, org.springframework.security.web.authentication.www.BasicAuthenticationFilter.doFilter throws the RTE if the Authentication header contains malformed base 64. The effect is that http servers return 500 rather than  401.
My fix just adds an additional check by calling Base64.isBase64, and if that fails, continues processing as if the Authentication header were missing.
