Empty context path in LogoutFilter and AbstractProcessingFilter
When context path is empty, LogoutFilter erroneously believes "/anything/before/j_acegi_logout" is a logout URL.  The requiresLogout() method should use uri.equals(request.getContextPath() + filterProcessesUrl) instead of uri.endsWith(request.getContextPath() + filterProcessesUrl), or more simple, uri.endsWith(filterProcessesUrl) to detect any URL ending with j_acegi_logout.
