TokenBasedRememberMeServices fail with empty password
In case of an empty password, the service fails because of the Assert.hasLength(password) in the loginSuccess method.
Fails heavily, with 500 page shown to the user.
However I could not find any contract that the password can&amp;apos;t be empty. Could you please change this behaviour to simply skip cookie creation in case of an empty username/password?
Like:
		if (StringUtils.hasLength(username) &amp;&amp; StringUtils.hasLength(password)) 
{

			long expiryTime = System.currentTimeMillis()
					+ (getTokenValiditySeconds() * 1000);
			// And so on
		}
