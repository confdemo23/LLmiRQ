OpenIDAuthenticationFilter should encode URL parameters
OpenIDAuthenticationFilter has the ability to propagate existing query parameters on the request through the return_to URL submitted as part of the OpenID authentication process. However, these values are not encoded as application/x-www-form-urlencoded, leading to potential ambiguities later on if these values contain reserved characters.
