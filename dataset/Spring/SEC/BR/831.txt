JdbcAclService incompatible with postgres
JdbcAclService contains the following definition:
private static final String selectAclObjectWithParent = "select obj.object_id_identity obj_id, class.class class "
        + "from acl_object_identity obj, acl_object_identity parent, acl_class class "
        + "where obj.parent_object = parent.id and obj.object_id_class = class.id "
        + "and parent.object_id_identity = ? and parent.object_id_class = ("
        + "select id FROM acl_class where acl_class.class = ?)";
Postgres cannot execute this query as it requires the AS keyword for aliasing.
The following query works in postgres:
select obj.object_id_identity AS obj_id, class.class AS class  from acl_object_identity obj, acl_object_identity parent, acl_class class where obj.parent_object = parent.id and obj.object_id_class = class.id and parent.object_id_identity = ? and parent.object_id_class = (select id FROM acl_class where acl_class.class = ?)
It would be desirable if this and other sql statements were configurable.
