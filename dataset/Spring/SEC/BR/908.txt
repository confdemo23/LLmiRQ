BasePermission.buildFromName(name) does not find static permission in class
I am converting from Acegi 1.0.3.
This code:
     BasePermission.buildFromName(name)
With name having the value "WRITE" (a permission within BasePermission) throws this assertion error:
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unknown permission &amp;apos;WRITE&amp;apos;
        at org.springframework.util.Assert.isTrue(Assert.java:65)
        at org.springframework.security.acls.domain.DefaultPermissionFactory.bui
ldFromName(DefaultPermissionFactory.java:108)
        at org.springframework.security.acls.domain.AbstractRegisteredPermission
.buildFromName(AbstractRegisteredPermission.java:33)
After a little debugging, the registeredPermissionsByName Map is in fact empty.
I could be wrong, but I believe the problem is that java will call the method in the superclass of BasePermission and not execute the static initializer. I could get around this problem by hacking an inner class to use the BasePermission constructor before using this method (which forces the static initializer to execute).
