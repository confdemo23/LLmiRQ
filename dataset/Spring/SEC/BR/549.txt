AuthenticationProcessingFilter should trim white space from user name
When a user logs in with either leading or trailing white space in their user name, authentication still succeeds (we are using a org.acegisecurity.providers.ldap.authenticator.BindAuthenticator), authorities are correctly populated.  However the leading or trailing white space is never removed from the user name, so auth.getName() will include the white space.
Later when JdbcMutableAclService searches for the ACL_SID table or inserts into the ACL_SID table the unwanted white space is used in the where clause or even worse in the insert (if the SID record is being created for the user).
I&amp;apos;m not 100% sure if the ACL queries are incorrect and should perform a trim() on the ACL_SID.sid column, or whether the problem is more fundamental, and the AuthenticationProcessingFilter should perform a trim() after it obtains the user name from the request.
My current thinking leads me to believe the AuthenticationProcessingFilter is at fault, and it should perform the trim() on the user name, as allowing trailing or leading white space in user names sounds like a recipe for confusion.
