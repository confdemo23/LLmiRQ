Method FilterBasedLdapUserSearch#searchForUser(String username) creates an unsed  DirContext which never closed
The org.acegisecurity.ldap.searchFilterBasedLdapUserSearch#searchForUser(String username)  method create an DirContext in the first line. This DirContext create/use a connection to ldap server. This DirContext is only used for an debug level log output. The great problem is that this DirContext is never closed and the ldap connection is not closed or released to connection pool.
