Bad Spring Security XSD Version Error Message
When applicationContext.xml includes an old Spring Security XSD, the error message is misleading, indicating that version 3.2 needs to be used (I was using 3.2), when 4.0+ actually needs to be used.
The Reference URL indicates the erroneous line.
Note that this has been a problem in the past:
https://jira.spring.io/browse/SEC-2145
Perhaps it&amp;apos;s worth considering a dynamically-created error message?
