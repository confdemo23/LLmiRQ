NamspaceHandler logs error if web module not present
The SecurityNamespaceHandler in the config module tries to load FilterChainProxy (which it probably shouldn&amp;apos;t anyway?) although one might not have included the Spring Security web module as one might only want to use global methd security in the first place. The pom.xml of the config module actually states the web module to be optional but apparently the code is not.
Of course Spring Security works just fine without the web module present but logging an error is at least irritating then.
