Value of attribute create-session in schema based configuration should set property ExceptionTranslationFilter.createSessionAllowed
I am trying to set up a security configuration for a simple web service application using basic (and digest) authentication. There is a requirement that my application should never create HttpSessions, but this is violated as a result of the default value of ExceptionTranslationFilter.createSessionAllowed (true). There seems to be no way to set the value of this property when using schema based configuration.
In my opinion the attribute create-session should affect the value of ExceptionTranslationFilter.createSessionAllowed;
ifRequired: true
always: true
never: false
A relatively easy workaround is to not use schema based configuration......
