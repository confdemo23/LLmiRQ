UserMap should work with UserDetails, not User concrete class
The UserMap.getUser method returns a User object, however the UserMap.addUser method takes in the UserDetails interface as a parameter.so if a user-defined class that implements the UserDetails interface is used a ClassCastException is exception is thrown since the object will not be of type Uer.
The suggested change to the getUser method is return the UserDetails interface along with actually changing the implementation of the getUserMethod from:
     public User getUser(String username) throws UsernameNotFoundException {
        User result = (User) this.userMap.get(username.toLowerCase());
        if (result == null) 
{
            throw new UsernameNotFoundException("Could not find user: "
                + username);
        }
        return result;
    }
To 
    public User getUser(String username) throws UsernameNotFoundException {
        UserDetails result = (UserDetails) this.userMap.get(username.toLowerCase());
        if (result == null) 
{
            throw new UsernameNotFoundException("Could not find user: "
                + username);
        }
        return result;
    }
