AbstractRetryEntryPoint always uses RetryWithHttpEntryPoint logger
AbstractRetryEntryPoint  has a static logger defined by RetryWithHttpEntryPoint.class, instead of using a non-static getLogger(getClass()) or an abstract Log getLogger() function that would be implemented in both RetryWithHttpEntryPoint and RetryWithHttpsEntryPoint to provide the correct class for logging.
The impact is that log messages for the RetryWithHttpsEntryPoint get logged under the RetryWithHttpEntryPoint logger.
