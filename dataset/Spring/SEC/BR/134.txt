Authentication.getAuthorities should return a collection rather than an array.
Currently Authentication.getAuthorities returns a GrantedAuthority[]. This is dangerous because calling code can accidentaly or deliberatly modify elements of the array to anything.
This method should really return an unmodifiable collection. Alternatly class instances could return a clone of the array.
