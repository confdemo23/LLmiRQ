AccessControlListTag class Javadoc incorrect
The class-level Javadoc for AccessControlListTag incorrectly states that there must be exactly one SidRetrievalStrategy bean on the application context. While the tag will complain if multiple such beans exist, there is no issue if no SidRetrievalStrategy implementations exist. In that event AccessControlListTag simply creates a SidRetrievalStrategyImpl instance and uses that.
