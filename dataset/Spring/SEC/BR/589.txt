BasicLookupStrategy#readAclsById(ObjectIdentity[], Sid[]), throws exception, when a warning log would do
There is a small section of code at the end org.acegisecurity.acls.jdbc.BasicLookupStrategy that iterates through all the supplied ObjectIdentities, and checks that an Acl has been found for each.  If any ObjectIdentity does not have a corresponding Acl an exception is thrown.
I would assume that in some applications there may not be an Acl for every single domain object under Acl control, as projects using this library may decide to create Acls only as needed, and the absence of an Acl means no access. This  makes an exception too strong.
I think logging a warning to a commons logger would be more suitable, some thing like
         // Now we&amp;apos;re done, check every requested object identity was found 
        // and log it.
        if (LOG.isWarnEnabled()) {
          for (int i = 0; i &lt; objects.length; i++) {
              if (!result.containsKey(objects[i])) 
{
                  LOG.warn("Unable to find ACL information for object identity &amp;apos;"
                      + objects[i].toString() + "&amp;apos;");
              }
          }
        }
        return result;
    }
