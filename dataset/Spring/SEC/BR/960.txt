DN Encoding in LDAPUserDetailsManager.changePassword() causes bind errors
Please see the write-up here:

This prevents changepassword operations by binding as the user.  Normally, binding as the admin to change the password will work, but certain LDAP directory servers (such as Novell eDirectory) have a policy that sets the user&amp;apos;s account to expire after some small time period whenever an admin user changes a password.  However, this side-effect is undesirable when it&amp;apos;s actually the user changing the password.
