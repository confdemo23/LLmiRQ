    &lt;/session-management&gt;

The presence of &lt;concurrency-control&gt; causes a ConcurrentSessionControlStrategy to be created. Since this extends SessionFixationProtectionStrategy it forces the enabling of session migration, even if session fixation protection is set to "none". I have verified this by looking at the code. This is pretty big problem, and the documentation certainly does not indicate that this was intentional.
A change to how this whole system works was proposed in SEC-2135. The resolution for that enhancement request will also fix this bug. However, the bug probably needs to exist for tracking and historical purposes.
