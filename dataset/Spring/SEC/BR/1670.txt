SpringSecurityLdapTemplate should use a CompositeName to remove JNDI escaping from SearchResult.getName()
SearchResult.getName() returns a CompositeName syntax, so JNDI special characters will be escaped, which we don&amp;apos;t want in a pure-LDAP name. The result should be wrapped in a CompositeName() before passing to the constructor for DistinguishedName. The latter knows how to deal with CompositeNames.
