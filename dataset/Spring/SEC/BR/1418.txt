equals of GrantedAuthorityImpl isn&apos;t symmetric
The implementation of equals in GrantedAuthorityImpl returns true if it sees a String with the same content as its role field. So
new GrantedAuthorityImpl("ROLE_ADMIN").equals("ROLE_ADMIN") will return true, but "ROLE_ADMIN".equals(new GrantedAuthorityImpl("ROLE_ADMIN")) won&amp;apos;t!
The equals method is required to be symetric, but this implementation isn&amp;apos;t symmetric.
Apart from that equals should be final or test explicit for GrantedAuthorityImpl.class. Using instanceof in non-final classes with a non-final equals method is not ok.
Please read: Joshua Bloch - Effective Java - Second Edition - Item 8 Page 33 following.
I attached a SimpleGrantedAuthority.java which uses a very save implementation. This class is final. I know that GrantedAuthorityImpl has subclasses, but it should be consindered if the trivial sharing of the role field justify the equals problems. It always very difficult to design proper equals and hashCode for subclassable classes.
Since GrantedAuthorityImpl is really a value class like String, it should be really final and immutable like String itself.
