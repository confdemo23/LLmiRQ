SwitchUserProcessingFilter modifies the switchFailureUrl member variable on failure
The code in redirectToFailureUrl() prepends the contextPath to the member variable every time there is a failure. If the contextPath isn&amp;apos;t "" this means that the second time there is a failure the client will be redirected to an invalid page. Here&amp;apos;s the faulty code:
        if (switchFailureUrl != null) 
{
            switchFailureUrl = request.getContextPath() + switchFailureUrl;
            response.sendRedirect(response.encodeRedirectURL(switchFailureUrl));
        }
 else {
Why not use the sendRedirect() method which is used for targetUrl? E.g.:
        if (switchFailureUrl != null) 
{
            sendRedirect(request, response, switchFailureUrl);
        }
 else {
This fix also means that the useRelativeContext property will actually be used also on failures. I think the user of SwitchUserProcessingFilter would expect that.
