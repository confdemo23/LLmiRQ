Remove ERROR log when Spring Security is embedded into an UberJar
We embed Spring Security and Spring DI into a common Uber-Jar as part of a Dropwizard application.
We use the Gradle Shadow plugin to do this (the Gradle version of the Maven Shade plugin).
However, as soon as we add an implementation version to the generated JAR
Spring Security logs an ERROR at start up:
e.g.
ERROR [2013-08-29 15:09:23,322] org.springframework.security.core.SpringSecurityCoreVersion: *** Spring Major version &amp;apos;3&amp;apos; expected, but you are running with version: 1.1.4-SNAPSHOT. Please check your classpath for unwanted jar files.
This error should be changed to either a WARN or an INFO. 
It is very unnerving for customers to see an ERROR like this at start up and they will raise support tickets or alert sysadmins.
Alternatively, there should be a way to disable this check programmatically or via configuration.
See reproducible test case:
https://github.com/jacek99/dropwizard-spring-di-security-onejar-example
git clone it and then using Gradle 1.6 or higher execute
gradle runShadow
You will see the error on the screen.
