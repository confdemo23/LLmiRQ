New Acl package not compatible with Mysql Db
The sql statements JdbcAclService and JdbcMutableAclService are only compatible with hsqlDb but not with other DBs e.g. mysql. the "call identity()" for example query must be "SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID()" in mysql dialect.
So it would be great if you could access the ...Query properties via setter-methods and configure JdbcMutableAclService via spring beans xml.
also have a look at this thread please:
