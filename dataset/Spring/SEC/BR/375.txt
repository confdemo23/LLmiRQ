AuthorizedEvent published by before filter but not by after filter
All of the interceptors (filter, method, aspectj) do a before pass and an after pass on the request. 
The before and after filtering methods are shared among the filtere and are implemented in the base class AbstractSecurityInterceptor.
The method AbstractSecurityInterceptor.before publishes an AuthorizedEvent if the authorization is successful.
The method AbstractSecurityInterceptor.after 
    delegates to the afterInvocationManager
    if you use the AfterInfocationProviderManager, that invokes a List of Providers in turn.
There is no AuthorizedEvent published if the authorization succeeds.   To be consistent, the AuthorizedEvent should be published whenever the authorization succeeds.
