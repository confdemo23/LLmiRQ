[patch] MessageDigestPasswordEncoder#encodePassword is platform-dependant (with fix)
MessageDigestPasswordEncoder#encodePassword uses saltedPass.getBytes() which is highly platform-dependant (it uses the platform&amp;apos;s default charset).
Creating a new user account (with "strong" salt: accents, weird chars, etc.) on a Linux machine, moving the server to Mac OS X or Windows, and trying to access the same user account fails.
Fix: replace:
saltedPass.getBytes()
with:
saltedPass.getBytes(org.apache.commons.lang.CharEncoding.UTF_8)
In theory, the new String(...) a couple of lines later /should/ specify an encoding too (e.g. ISO-Latin-9, AKA ISO-8859-15). But since we are dealing with a sub-set of ASCII, there is no encoding problem here.
