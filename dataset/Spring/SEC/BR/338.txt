Serialization Issues for Authentication implementations
When used in a distributed environment, several Serialization issues have appeared. 
1. GrantedAuthority interface does not implement serializable, thus poses a potential problem for its implementations, when being sent over the wire.
2. Authentication implementations do not explicitly overwride the serialVersionUID, which have caused a Serialization exception when different patch versions of acegi where loaded in the VM on different ends of the wire (1.0.0 and 1.0.1).  The problem was the AnonymousAuthenticationToken object which had an extra constructor added in one and not the other, but potential exists that any future minor or patch releases of the same major could alter the structure of the class, thus preventing it to serialize to a backwards-compatable lower version.
