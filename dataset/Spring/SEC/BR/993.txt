OpenID and RememberMe broken
I&amp;apos;m trying to create a remember-me cookie with an OpenID authentication. Since OpenIDAuthenticationToken doesn&amp;apos;t support password, it&amp;apos;s causing a NullPointerException in TokenBasedRememberMeServices.retrievePassword() - it calls toString() on the null password ("return authentication.getCredentials().toString();" line 202).
How am I supposed to use cookies with OpenID? If I create my own RememberMeServices and leave out the password then anyone can create a cookie with my OpenID and log in as me.
