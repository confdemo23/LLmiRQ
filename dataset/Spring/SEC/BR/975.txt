Namespace access-denied-page attribute does not work with property placeholders
Hello,
I am trying to use a property inside Spring security:
	&lt;security:http 
		access-denied-page="$
{security.errorPage}
"
 ...&gt;
		...
	&lt;/security:http&gt;
Where security.errorPage is a property defined in a property file loaded by a org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer bean.
But it is not interpreted.
Looking at org.springframework.security.config.HttpSecurityBeanDefinitionParser I got the confirmation it is not a case.
I don&amp;apos;t know if it is a feature but I think it may be useful.
Philippe.
