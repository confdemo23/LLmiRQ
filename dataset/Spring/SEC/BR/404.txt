Logout when not logged in cause NullPointerException
When a user attempts to logout when they aren&amp;apos;t logged in (e.g. when their session has expired) a NullPointerException occurs in TokenBasedRememberMeServices.logout(TokenBasedRememberMeServices.java:295).
The line that fails is:
        cancelCookie(request, response, "Logout of user " + authentication.getName());
I guess the cookie should still be cancelled, so the change might simply be to change the line to something like:
        cancelCookie(request, response, "Logout of user " + authentication == null ? "Unknown" : authentication.getName());
