Unable to use NtlmAwareLdapAuthenticator with LdapAuthenticationProvider due to checking for null password.  
Currently LdapAuthenticatonProvider checks for empty password in its authenticate() method (lines 225 onward). This does not allow to use NtlmAwareLdapAuthenticator as a delegate for authentication because null password will be always rejected - as is the case when using NTLM authentication - and NtlmAwareLdapAuthenticator never gets called.  
Forum thread mentioned above confirms the same problem encountered by another user (see item 2 in the top post)
