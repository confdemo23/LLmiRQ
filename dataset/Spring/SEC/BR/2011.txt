SessionFixationProtectionStrategy Javadoc states to inject SessionRegistry but does not contain that field
The SessionFixationProtectionStrategy Javadoc says:






If concurrent session control is in use, then a SessionRegistry must be injected. 






However, this feature is offered by the subclass ConcurrentSessionControlStrategy. Another reference to the session registry is in the org.springframework.security.web.authentication.session.SessionFixationProtectionStrategy.onAuthentication(Authentication, HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse) Javadoc:






The sessionRegistry will be updated with the new session information.






Once again, this is done by the org.springframework.security.web.authentication.session.ConcurrentSessionControlStrategy.onAuthentication(Authentication, HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse) instead.
