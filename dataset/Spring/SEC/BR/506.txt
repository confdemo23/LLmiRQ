DigestProcessingFilter improperly parsing Authorization request header when individual values contain commas
DigestProcessingFilter improperly parses the Authorization request header. It converts the header to an array of strings based on the assumption that the individual values don&amp;apos;t contain comma.
I ran into the problem when the query string of a URL contained commas. RFC 1738 has the following to say about commas:
    Thus, only alphanumerics, the special characters "$-_.+!*&amp;apos;(),", and
    reserved characters used for their reserved purposes may be used
    unencoded within a URL.
As you can see, the comma is in the list of "special characters" that may be used unencoded.
DigestProcessingFilter works correctly when I URL encode the commas but I should not be expected to encode the commas according to the RFC. Also, what about the other pieces of the Authorization header such as username, realm, etc? DigestProcessingFilter should properly handle the case when they contain commas.
