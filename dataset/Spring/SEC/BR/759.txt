GrantedAuthoritiesContainer should extend Serializable
GrantedAuthority&amp;apos;s are Serializable, so it makes sense to make GrantedAuthoritiesContainer serializable as well. 
GrantedAuthoritiesContainer not being serializable is currently a problem for us because we sometimes need to serialize the Authentication object, which contains a (pre-authenticated) GrantedAuthoritiesContainer as part of the authentication details.
