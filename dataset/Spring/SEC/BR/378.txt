Authz taglib not working for group names with spaces
I am evaluating Acegi and have it setup against our corporate Active Directory. Things seems to be working fine.
But, all our groups in AD contains spaces eg. "CPHG AD ADMINS". The authz taglib does not seem to support this?
I can use eg. request.isUserInRole("CPHG AD ADMINS") and all groups are listed if I print getAuthorities() from authentication.
I tried creating a role with no spaces and it worked. 
Is there any reason not to support spaces in role/group names ?
