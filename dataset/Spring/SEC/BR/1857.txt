ContextPropagatingRemoteInvocation does not correctly propagate the principal
ContextPropagatingRemoteInvocation was changed so that the principal and credentials were propagated via the toString method (see https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SEC-1741), as follows: 
principal = currentUser.getPrincipal().toString(); 
credentials = currentUser.getCredentials().toString(); 
However, this only works if the toString method actually returns the principals name and in the case of principal of type org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.User it returns a description of the User object, not the name.
I suggest the solution is as follows (it works for me at least): 
principal = currentUser.getName(); 
credentials = currentUser.getCredentials().toString();
Any more info required just let me know.
