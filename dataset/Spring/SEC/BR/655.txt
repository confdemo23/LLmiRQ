When inserting ACE&apos;s in a parent ACL it&apos;s possible to end up with a child ACL that has a stale reference to its parent
The JdbcMutableAclService in its updateAcl method evicts the ObjectIdentity from the cache. However, it should probably evict child ObjectIdentities too whose parent ACL now is no longer in cache.
