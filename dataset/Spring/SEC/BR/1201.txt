PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer does not work for intercept-url attributes
Hello,
I need to define a property placeholder to configure the access for an intercept URL pattern:
&lt;security:http&gt;
  &lt;security:intercept-url pattern="/**" access="ROLE_$
{access.role}
" /&gt;
&lt;/security:http&gt;
As the HttpSecurityBeanDefinitionParser doesn&amp;apos;t create BeanDefinitions for any the properties (and sub-properties) that are passed to the FilterSecurityInterceptor, the PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer can&amp;apos;t substitute them. This issue looks very equal to SEC-975, but I guess it&amp;apos;s a little harder to solve as the pattern-access map resides deeper in the object hierarchy.
Kind regards
Marc
