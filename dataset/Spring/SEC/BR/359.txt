LogoutFilter ordering
When a user does not have a session and attempts to logout, the LogoutFilter does nothing.  The is because the Authentication object returned from the SessionContext is null
            Authentication auth = SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication();
            if (logger.isDebugEnabled()) 
{
                logger.debug("Logging out user &amp;apos;" + auth + "&amp;apos; and redirecting to logout page");
            }

            if (auth != null) {
                for (int i = 0; i &lt; handlers.length; i++) 
{
                    handlers[i].logout(httpRequest, httpResponse, auth);
                }
            }
This happens because the SecurityContext was not read from the Session and the filters that make it available have not executed yet.
By moving the logoutFilter to after the rememberMeFilter, the problem seems to be resolved:
httpSessionContextIntegrationFilter,authenticationProcessingFilter,basicProcessingFilter,contextHolderAwareRequestFilter,rememberMeProcessingFilter,logoutFilter,anonymousProcessingFilter,exceptionTranslationFilter,filterInvocationInterceptor
