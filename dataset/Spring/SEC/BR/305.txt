HttpSessionContextIntegrationFilter to retain SecurityContext when rendering error pages
This happens when you want to set up error pages as described in SRV.9.9.2 Error Pages in Java Servlet Specification
Version 2.4.
If for example want to display the current user name on an error page, the security context does not contain the authenticated user.
The reason is believed to be that HttpSessionContextIntegrationFilter is only applied once per request.
