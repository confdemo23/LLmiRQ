BasicLookupStrategy, JdbcAclService, and JdbcMutableAclService should support Catalog and Schema
Some systems may have security objects and normal application objects seperated in to different domains, and those domains may be defined in different database catalogs and/or schemas.
The BasicLookupStrategy, JdbcAclService, and JdbcMutableAclService classes should account for a database catalog and schema.  A developer and/or integrator should be able to specify the catalog and schema for said classes when defining the beans in their context configurations.
