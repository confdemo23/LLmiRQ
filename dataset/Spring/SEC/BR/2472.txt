Can&apos;t use recommended BCryptPasswordEncoder for PasswordComparisonAuthenticator on a Ldap Authenticator
According to the Spring Security Reference for version 3.2, we should use BCryptPasswordEncoder for encrypting passwords.  The class org.springframework.security.ldap.authentication.AbstractLdapAuthenticator has a method setPasswordEncoder that takes a single parameter of type org.springframework.security.authentication.encoding.PasswordEncoder, which is an interface that is deprecated.  All known classes that implement that interface are deprecated and represent various encryption algorithms that are no longer recommended.  org.springframework.security.crypto.bcrypt.BCryptPasswordEncoder (the recommended encoder) does not implement that deprecated interface, it implements org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder (tricky because the interface name is the same, but belongs to a different package as the deprecated interface).  The parameter type on the method setPasswordEncoder in the class org.springframework.security.ldap.authentication.AbstractLdapAuthenticator needs to be changed to org.springframework.security.crypto.password.PasswordEncoder.
