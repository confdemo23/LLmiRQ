Document/Fix CSRF behavior with pre-auth
3.2.0.RC1 with &lt;http auto-config="true"&gt;  with &lt;csrf/&gt; and a preauth filter
When a user first accesses a pre-authed site
1. the CSRF token is added to the session.
2. The pre-auth filter creates the Authentication and related security context
3. The SessionManagementFilter then runs, and since its a new auth and session it calls &amp;apos;CsrfAuthenticationStrategy&amp;apos; which removes the CSRF token from the session.
4. The return view now has an invalid CSRF token in any forms.
A 2nd GET creates a new CSRF token, and then everything works normally.
--------------------------------
I posted my workaround in the forum, but it would nice to:
1. Document the behavior/workaround in
http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/3.2.x-SNAPSHOT/reference/html/csrf.html
so that others don&amp;apos;t have the same issue.
2. Offer a better way (or workaround) to remove the CsrfAuthenticationStrategy from the session management.
Is defining my own custom CSRF filter and repository a "cleaner" workaround to defining my own session management filter?
Or is updating the xsd, and doing something like &lt;csrf auth-strategy="disable"/&gt; a possibility?
