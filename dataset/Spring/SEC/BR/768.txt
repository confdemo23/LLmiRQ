Namespace throws IllegalStateException if no namespace filters are used and a entry-point-ref isn&apos;t set
The cas client sample is an example. It doesn&amp;apos;t use basic, form or OpenID login through the namespace. An error should be reported through the parserContext rather than throwing an exception.
