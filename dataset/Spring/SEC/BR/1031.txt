LdapShaPasswordEncoder.isPasswordValid startOfHash off by one
in LdapShaPasswordEncoder.isPasswordValid the startOfHash variable is initialized to prefix.length() + 1.
This causes the first character of the hash values to be skipped in the subsequent equals invocation.
Is there some (undocumented) reason that the first character of the hash is being skipped, or is this a bug?
Example:
encPass = "
{SHA}nU4eI71bcnBGqeO0t9tXvY1u5oQ="
rawPass = "pass"
prefix = "{SHA}
"
startOfHash = 6 (should be 5: prefix.length())
encodedRawPass = "U4eI71bcnBGqeO0t9tXvY1u5oQ=" (should be "nU4eI71bcnBGqeO0t9tXvY1u5oQ=")
