PathBasedFilterInvocationDefinitionMap ignores text after the last question mark instead of the first
In some of our legacy code, we actually have URLs that contain successURLs as a request parameter. This means it is possible to have more than one question mark in the URL. For example,
/Register?cmd=initial&amp;Security_steps=All&amp;Security_successUrl=https://localhost/appName/servletName?cmd=Start
Check out line 89 and 90 of PathBasedFilterInvocationDefinitionMap:
// Strip anything after a question mark symbol, as per SEC-161.
int firstQuestionMarkIndex = url.lastIndexOf("?");
Should this be changed to
int firstQuestionMarkIndex = url.indexOf("?");
so that all query parameters are ignored?
