z/OS Password Encoding Error
Package: org.springframework.security.authentication.encoding
LdapShaPasswordEncoding.java
Fix - line 104:  has been tested with "org.springframework.security.core_3.0.3.RELEASE" on z/OS 1.12
was:        return prefix + new String(Base64.encode(hash));
change:  return prefix + new String(Base64.encode(hash), "UTF-8");
MD4PasswordEncoder.java  also looks like it has same issue.
