CasAuthenticationProvider does not copy the details object into Authentication
If we want to have audit logging and check for authenticate event, with cas the user details are not copied in this first even thus we are unable to know from which ip the authenticate event is originating from (or whatever else information is carried in the details).
The WebAuthenticationDetails in the passed authentication object is copied to the CasAuthenticationToken only after it has been published (see AbstractAuthenticationManager::authenticate(Authentication)) , thus in the AuthenticationEvent you miss the servlet request where it is originating.
I did a workaround to do it as follows:
public class CasAuthenticationProvider extends org.acegisecurity.providers.cas.CasAuthenticationProvider {
    public Authentication authenticate(Authentication authentication) throws AuthenticationException 
{
        CasAuthenticationToken result =  (CasAuthenticationToken)super.authenticate(authentication);
        copyDetails(authentication, result);
        return result;
    }

    protected void copyDetails(Authentication source, CasAuthenticationToken dest) {
        if (dest.getDetails() == null) 
{
            Object details = source.getDetails();
            dest.setDetails(details);
        }
    }
}
