TokenBasedRememberMeServices not properly using context path when setting cookie paths (SEC-206 only partially fixed) 
SEC-206 addressed an issue to ensure the context path is properly used when setting remember me cookie paths by using the code:
cookie.setPath(request.getContextPath());
However, http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/docs/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletRequest.html#getContextPath() states that &amp;apos;For servlets in the default (root) context, this method returns "" &amp;apos;.
An empty cookie path results in inconsistent behavior between ie and firefox: ie presumes "/" whereas firefox presumes the leading path for the current request.
If request.getContextPath() returns "", the cookie path should be set to "/" to properly reflect a cookie set for the root context.
This fix should be applied to both methods: makeValidCookie and makeCancelCookie of TokenBasedRememberMeServices.
