YarnContainerClusterMvcEndpoint registered twice
It looks like we get YarnContainerClusterMvcEndpoint under `/yarn_containercluster` and `/yarn_containercluster/yarn_containercluster`. I think this is caused by @RequestMapping which I believe is not needed anymore in boot mvc endpoints and now causes this double.
