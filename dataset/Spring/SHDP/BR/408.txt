DatasetTemplate doesn&apos;t close writer if exception is thrown
If org.springframework.data.hadoop.store.dataset.DatasetTemplate.write(Collection) gets into trouble when underlying writer throws an exception, writer is not closed and dfs client lease is not cleared. Vanilla hadoop 2.5.1 and  cdh5(2.5.0-cdh5.2.0) barks this in logs.






17:38:22,522  WARN      org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.LeaseRenewer: 458 - Failed to renew lease for [DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_-1719730779_11] for 30 seconds.  Will retry shortly ...




java.net.ConnectException: Call From neo.localdomain/127.0.1.1 to localhost:39583 failed on connection exception: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused; For more details see:  http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/ConnectionRefused






In these tests minicluster has already been shutdown but dfs client background thread is still trying to renew a lease which will never going to happen. This can be seen i.e. using test org.springframework.data.hadoop.store.dataset.DatasetTemplateNoNullsTests.testWritePojoWithNullValuesShouldFail()
