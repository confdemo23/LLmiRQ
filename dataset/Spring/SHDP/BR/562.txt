Missing trailing slash on spring.yarn.applicationDir path fails to localize
If the trailing slash is not included in the spring.yarn.applicationDir property then the relevant files are distributed to HDFS but they are not then localized to the appmaster/container.
There are two minor issues with this:

This could be automatically handled to allow the files to be localized correctly.
The only error is when launch_container.sh fails with Error: Unable to access jarfile, which does not help with identifying the issue.
