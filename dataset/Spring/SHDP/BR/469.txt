DefaultYarnContainer should not exit without @YarnComponent
DefaultYarnContainer is a default when run/configured via boot and is really expected to be used together with one or more @YarnComponent. Possible method return values are then used to send event which ContainerLauncherRunner catches and does a real context/app exit. However if no @YarnComponent methods are used, thus not results, container exists immediately which something we don&amp;apos;t want or something user expects.
We should simple disable container end state processing if there are no @YarnComponent and thus there are no results. This is better expected functionality especially if container simply fires up rest methods and want to stay running. Order to exit gracefully from container user can still add @YarnComponent method and either sleep there or return Future and set return value later using a Future handle.
