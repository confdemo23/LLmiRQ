Remove unsupported lzo codecs.
Docs are a little misleading for usage of LZO, SLZO, LZOP and SLZOP. Lets just leave lzo there because additional split work by twitter is not truly split stream on codec level. Or at least they never implemented the SplittableCompressionCodec interface which makes is unusable outside of MR record reader.
