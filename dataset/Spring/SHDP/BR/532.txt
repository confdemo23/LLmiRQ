Container cluster may start wrong member
Defining two groups and starting only one may result first allocated container to get matched from a group which is not running, effectively starting a wrong container. Looks to be caused be a fact that grid projection is attached to projected grid when cluster is created thus allowing projection to get matched there.
Should handle this so that attach doesn&amp;apos;t happen until group is started.
