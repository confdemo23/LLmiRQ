StaticEventingAppmaster hangs forever with -100 container exit status 
In a cluster running Hortonwork HDP 2.1.3, we shut down a NodeManager and all running application containers on that node exited with -100 status (lost node scenario). However, we observed that all staticEventingAppmasters for these containers were hanging forever. 
Potential cause is that onContainerCompleted() returns without invoking notifyCompleted() given -100 exit status due to a lost node.
