Can&apos;t run mapreduce job in local mode
I would like to run the mapreduce jobs without running any hadoop server or having HDFS to test them. So I use mapreduce.framework.name=local. Unfortunately the org.springframework.data.hadoop.mapreduce.JobUtils#getRunningJob sets this configuration like this:






				Configuration cfg = job.getConfiguration();




				cfg.set("mapreduce.framework.name", "yarn");






I could override this while debugging and could run the job but can&amp;apos;t do this from configuration. Can you tell me why is this here and can you remove it or make it configurable or tell me why should I not use local mode?
I only tested this with 2.0.0-RELEASE but the code is there in version 2.1.0.M1 too.
