Scripts don&apos;t try EVAL after EVALSHA fails
(noticed after upgrading from 1.3.1 to 1.4.1, then adding a new script)
If I run a script that hasn&amp;apos;t been run on the Redis before, Spring executes EVALSHA first, which fails with error "NOSCRIPT", throwing an exception.
In version 1.3.1 (expected): the exception is caught and EVAL is executed instead
In version 1.4.1 (bug): the exception caused by NOSCRIPT reaches my code, instead of being properly caught and handled.
