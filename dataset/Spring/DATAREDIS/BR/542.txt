RedisCache.putIfAbsent does not set the TTL on the element
RedisCache.putIfAbsent does not set the TTL on the element in redis. This appears to be because the RedisCachePutIfAbsentCallback performs the wrong check to decide whether it should set the TTL.
The check at
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-redis/blob/master/src/main/java/org/springframework/data/redis/cache/RedisCache.java#L725
Looks like it should check for null being returned from the set rather than checking equality with the supplied value.
