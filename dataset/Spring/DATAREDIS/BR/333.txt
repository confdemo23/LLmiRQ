EvalSha returns incorrect result
I use version 1.3.0 (not sure what is 1.3 GA (Dijkstra)).
Redis (in case of evalsha) returns bytes as String.
Spring Data Redis encodes them to bytes again (convert back for consistency) in JedisScriptReturnConverter.convert() method.
SafeEncoder.encode() uses UTF-8 charset for encoding but this encoding is incorrect. Probably Redis use other charset. Please check.
