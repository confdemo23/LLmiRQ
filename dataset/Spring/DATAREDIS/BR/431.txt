SELECT not called with @Caching annotations and Lettuce library
It seems like when items are put in the cache / retrieved from the cache using spring caching and when using the lettuce library (which i have recently switched to from jedis), that when a RedisConnection is retrieved from the pool and used by the RedisCache class, SELECT is not called and all the cache operations are happening in dbIndex 0, instead of the appropriate database index configured on the RedisTemplate.   I have confirmed that operations done using the redistemplate directly select the correct dbIndex before operations, but when simply using @Cacheable, @CachePut, and @CacheEvict attributes on a method the operations happen in dbIndex 0.
