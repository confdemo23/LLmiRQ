Update/Add guards in JedisConnetion that (no longer) require casts from long to int when exceeding Integer.MAX_VALUE
The Jedis API in JedisConnection has not been updated for a while. It was using the old Jedis API for expiries where time is passed as integer. As a workaround the expiration time was checked if it is &gt; Integer.MAX_VALUE which then caused the exception when calling pExpire(key, time) on JedisConnection in the pipeline with time in ms &gt; Integer.MAX_VALUE , which is 24 days.
This pull request removes this guard and uses new Jedis API that accepts long time instead of int. All tests pass.
