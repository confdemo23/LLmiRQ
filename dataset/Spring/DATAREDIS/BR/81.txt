Mixed lifecycle in RedisMessageListenerContainer
RedisMessageListenerContainer should not be invoking its start() method from afterPropertiesSet(). I believe it should follow the lifecycle of the enclosing class. In other words if one should be able to delegate to RedisMessageListenerContainer.start() method when its own start method is invoked.
