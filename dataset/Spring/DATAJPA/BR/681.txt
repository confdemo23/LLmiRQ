Execution of derived stored procedures fails if named parameters are used
If a derived stored procedure is used (like here in the Spring Data examples) and named parameters are enabled (e.g., through compiling with -parameters on JDK 8) the execution fails as the output parameter will always be bound by position. This effectively means mixing named and positional parameters which is forbidden by the JPA spec.
We should alter newAdhocStoredProcedureQuery() by using a synthetic output parameter name if named parameters are used.
