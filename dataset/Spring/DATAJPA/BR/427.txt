Sort by property of an associated object generates inner join instead of left join with QueryDsl and Hibernate
I have a custom repository implementation with QueryDsl predicate. When I sort by property of an associated object query that gets generated uses inner join instead left join statement.
I also have a custom repository implementation with JpaSpecification executor. There everything works well.
I have attached a test case.
