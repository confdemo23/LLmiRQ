Projections referring to collection attributes don&apos;t create a proper selection (missing joins)
I have model entity as below
Document &lt;-1-----M--&gt; Document
and repository method is "public List&lt;DocumentWithoutParent&gt; findByParentIsNull()"
where &amp;apos;DocumentWithoutParent&amp;apos; is projection
sql that hibernate generate is incorrect. but when I change List&lt;DocumentWithoutParent&gt; to List&lt;Document&gt; it is OK.
So I think problem come from spring data jpa.
Below is  a test project on this problem.
