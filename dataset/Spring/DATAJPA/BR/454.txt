Query on byte array fails
I have a blob which is mapped as a byte array in my entity. When creating a method to search on it in Spring JPA, I got an exception at server launch.
Entity:






@Entity




@Table(name = "CERTIFICATE")




public class Certificate {









	@Id




	@Column(name = "ID")




	@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)




	private Integer id;









	@Column(name = "CERTIFICATE")




	@Lob




	private byte[] binary;




	// Getters and setters present but not shown




}






DAO:






public interface CertificateDAO extends JpaRepository&lt;Certificate, Integer&gt; {









	public Certificate findByBinary(byte[] binary);




}






Exception in attached file. It seems that the array is always handled as a relation and thus try to generate a join. At line 453 of QueryUtils property.isCollection() is true.
