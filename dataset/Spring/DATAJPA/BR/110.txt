Error identifying &apos;alias&apos; when the entity&apos;s name has numbers
When a query is generated by spring-data, an error is provocated by org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.query.QueryUtils because does not recognize names of entities containing numbers. Example of entity name: T05User.
The error is on line 57 of class QueryUtils, the pattern does not match with words that contains numbers.






private static final String IDENTIFIER = "[\\p{L}._$]+";






A proposed solution is






private static final String IDENTIFIER = "[\\p{L}(\\d*)._$]+";
