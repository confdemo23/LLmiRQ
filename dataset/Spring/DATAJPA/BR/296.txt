Sort does not support case insensitive sorting 
Currently when using the Sort class in the findAll method, the results returned are always case sensitive.  For example, if the following names were sorted they would be returned in this order:
Dave
Oliver
kevin
I&amp;apos;m proposing that when sorting on properties that are Strings that it is possible to have the sort be case insensitive so that the results above would be returned as:
Dave
kevin
Oliver
