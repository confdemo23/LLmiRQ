Calls on Repository Methods with Pageable parameters fail when using horizontal partitioning (eclipseLink)
When a Repository method with a Pageable parameter is called this call results in a count query for the entity. If the entity is partitioned EclipseLink (imho every jpa provider) will fire this query on every node associated with the partitioned entity and union the result.
This means the result for the count is no longer one row but multiple rows which causes an exception.
Proposed Fix:
add a flag that can be configured per entity or per call (on the pageable?) that removes the count query.
alternatively remove the count query as it is very expensive anyway (at least on tables with a lot of rows, which is one of the main use cases for pageable requests).
