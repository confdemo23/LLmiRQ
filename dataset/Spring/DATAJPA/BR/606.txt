SQLGrammarException for IN-clause with empty collection as parameter
Consider the following repository method:






List&lt;AvatarEntity&gt; findByCategoryInOrderByCategoryAsc(List&lt;String&gt; categories);






When this method gets called with an empty list, it leads to the following exception:






Exception: javax.ejb.EJBTransactionRolledbackException: org.hibernate.exception.SQLGrammarException: could not extract ResultSet




Caused by: javax.persistence.PersistenceException: org.hibernate.exception.SQLGrammarException: could not extract ResultSet




Caused by: org.hibernate.exception.SQLGrammarException: could not extract ResultSet




Caused by: com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.MySQLSyntaxErrorException: You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near &amp;apos;) order by avatar0_.category asc&amp;apos; at line 1






which essentially happens with the malformed query






SELECT * FROM avatar WHERE category IN () ORDER BY category ASC;






As a workaround, callers have to check for an empty parameter list before invocation.
