Regression in 1.5.1 - Sort by property of an associated object doesn&apos;t work. Join property and INNER vs OUTER join when sorting
Order by a column on a join table seems to be filtering out null values again (INNER JOIN vs OUTER JOIN?). This is with an Oracle-backed db.
DATAJPA-346 fixed this issue, however after upgrading to 1.5.1 it has come back.
Library versions are:
spring-data-jpa 1.5.1.RELEASE
querydsl 3.3.2
hibernate 4.3.4.Final
When I try to sort on a joined column, the null joins are filtered out. When I change spring-dta-jpa to 1.5.0.RELEASE it works again without filtering with all other dependencies the same version.
Seems like a regression in 1.5.1.
The offending generated query is shown in both versions below






1.5.0 (working)






    select




        * 




    from




        (




        select




            &lt;&lt;all-my-select-cols&gt;&gt;




        from




            REQUEST request0_ 




        left outer join




            SITE_USER siteuser1_ 




                on request0_.ASSIGNED_TO=siteuser1_.ID 




        where




            request0_.ROW_END_DATE is null 




        order by




            lower(siteuser1_.FIRST_NAME) asc,




            lower(siteuser1_.LAST_NAME) asc) 




    where




        rownum &lt;= ?












1.5.1 (broke)






    select




        * 




    from




        (




        select




            &lt;&lt;all-my-select-cols&gt;&gt;




        from




            REQUEST request0_,




            SITE_USER siteuser1_ 




        where




            request0_.ASSIGNED_TO=siteuser1_.ID 




            and (




                request0_.ROW_END_DATE is null




            ) 




        order by




            lower(siteuser1_.FIRST_NAME) asc) 




    where




        rownum &lt;= ?






It also looks like my secondary order by column is missing (LAST_NAME), as the only thing I changed between runs was the spring-data-jpa version.
