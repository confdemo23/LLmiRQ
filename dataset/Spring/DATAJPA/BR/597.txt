Saving detatched entity breaks when moving from Spring Data JPA 1.5.3 to 1.6.2
We have working code that uses an older version of Spring Data JPA and some of our integration tests broke when we upgraded to 1.6.2.  I&amp;apos;ve created a self-contained Gradle project and put it up on GitHub for perusal and placed the link in the &amp;apos;Reference URL&amp;apos; field of this form.  If you change the versions of the Spring Data JPA library you will see how the test passes or fails depending on what library version is included.  For now, we&amp;apos;ll stay at 1.5.3 but we would like to be able to move our code forward at some point.  I search the database and found DATAJPA-581 might be a similar issue.
