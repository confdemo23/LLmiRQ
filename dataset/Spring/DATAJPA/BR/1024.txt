Querrying empty table for non-standard JPA type results in IllegalStateExcepion with the message "No aliases found in result tuple"
Related to DATAJPA-984. Querrying empty table for non-standard JPA type results in IllegalStateExcepion with the message "No aliases found in result tuple", instead of returning null.
In the linked git repository this is showcased with org.joda.time.LocalDate instances. Querries for standard types, e.g. java.time.LocalDate return null as expected. It would be nice if the behaviour was unified.
