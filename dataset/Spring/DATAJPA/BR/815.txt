order by qualifyReference when property begins with joinAlias
When a property begins with a joinAlias, the order by clause incorrectly assigns the qualifyReference boolean.
The following query shows the problem.  It assumes Cat.created and Dog.created exist, and a Sort column of "created".
from Cat c join Dog d
Because both tables have "created" as a column name and the property "created" begins with a joinAlias "c", the qualifyReference is set to false, resulting in "order by created" instead of "order by c.created".  This results in "column reference created is ambiguous".
I have attached a patch that resolves the issue.
