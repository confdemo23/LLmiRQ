QueryDslPredicateExecutor + EntityGraph + findAll
When overriding the findAll() method of  QueryDslPredicateExecutor with an @EntityGraph the query fails with:






org.hibernate.QueryException: query specified join fetching, but the owner of the fetched association was not present in the select list






What is the easiest way to provide a (non) working example? Sorry when I did something wrong, thats my first JIRA issue for Spring.
