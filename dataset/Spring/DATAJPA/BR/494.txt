Missing Imports in Spring Data JPA for Auditing
As mentioned in DATAJPA-482 there is a missing import package statement in spring data in conjunction with auditing. 
I have created an integration test which could be found on github. There is also a fragment-bundle, which adds the missing imports. 
There aren&amp;apos;t spring 3.2.8 Jars available yet, so i couldn&amp;apos;t test it against data jpa 1.5.0.
If the package "org.springframework.beans.factory.aspectj" is missing, the following exception will be thrown: org.springframework.beans.factory.parsing.BeanDefinitionParsingException: Configuration problem: Could not configure Spring Data JPA auditing-feature because spring-aspects.jar is not on the classpath!
If you want to use auditing please add spring-aspects.jar to the classpath.
I would suggest to add the Classname to the message.
