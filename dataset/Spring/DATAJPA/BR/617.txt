Named query lookups might cause transaction to be rolled back
The execution of a paged repository method backed by a JPA named query might break the currently running transaction as it tries to look up a named count query but can mitigate a lookup failure. However, the failing lookup causes the transaction to be marked as rollback (as required by the JPA specification).
We should revisit named query validation and execution like we did for manually defined queries using @Query in DATAJPA-350.
