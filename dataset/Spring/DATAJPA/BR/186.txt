Typos in log message when named query is used with a Pageable
Create a repository method as follows:

public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;User, Long&gt;
{
    Page&lt;User&gt; findAllByNameLike(String name, Pageable page);
}
When the application context is initialized, the following message appears in the logs:

INFO Finder method org.example.data.UserRepository.findAllByNameLike is backed by a NamedQuery but contains a Pageble parameter! Sorting deliviered via this Pageable will not be applied!
This message has two typos Pageble and deliviered.
