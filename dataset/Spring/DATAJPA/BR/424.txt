#entityName SpEL does not match alias regex when detecting alias
Using of the #entityName SpEL within the @Query annotation causes StringQuery.alias to become null because the query string cannot be matched against ALIAS_MATCH in QueryUtils.detectAlias().
This means that using Pageable parameters with repository methods do not evaluate the alias correctly when constructing the sorted query string, i.e. given the @Query on the repository method






@Query("SELECT o FROM #{#entityName} o WHERE o.orderState = :orderState")




public Page&lt;Order&gt; findOrders(@Param("orderState") OrderState orderState, Pageable pageable);






called from 






orderRepository.findOrders(state, new PageRequest(0, 10, Direction.DESC, "orderDate"))






then end query is parsed/resolved to






SELECT o FROM Order o WHERE o.orderState = :orderState  order by null.orderDate desc
