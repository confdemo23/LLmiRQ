@EnableJpaRepositories activates exception translation for @Repository classes not in basePackages
I have @Repository DAO classes that are not Spring Data repositories and are not part of the basePackages passed to @EnableJpaRepsitories(basePackages={}). They are incorrectly being activated for Spring DataAcessException translation and fail to autowire.
@Repository annotated classes in the basePackages passed to @EnableJpaRepsitories(basePackages={}) are correctly being activated for Spring DataAcessException translation.
After reading DATAJPA-112 and DATAJPA-221, I understand that @Repository makes a class eligible for Spring DataAccessException translation, but the basePackages paremeter of @EnableJpaRepositories implies I have control over which classes are translated.
