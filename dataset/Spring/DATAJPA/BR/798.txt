Repository query method fails when sorting with Pageable and query with line breaks.
I have a repository with a custom query (using @Query) that has line breaks in the String specifying the query, for readability in the repository interface and in the log output. Specifically, the problem is that the original query in the @Query annotation is not correctly parsed when there are line breaks between the FROM and the main ENTITY.






@Query(




	"	select m 																	\n"+




	"	from \n Movement as m 														\n"+	// WTF?? If there&amp;apos;s a new line between the FROM and the main entity class alias ("m") SpringData fails to parse the query correctly!!




	"		left join m.toAccount as toAcc												\n"+




	"		left join m.toAccount.owner as toOwn										\n"+




	"	where                                                                           								\n"+




	"		(:login is null or (m.account.owner.login = :login) or (toOwn.login = :login))			\n"+	// The owner of the account transferred from/to




	"		and (:accountId is null or (m.account.id = :accountId) or (toAcc.id = :accountId))		\n"+	// Transfers from/to this account




	"		and (:movTypeKey is null or m.type.key = :movTypeKey)                         			\n"+




	"		and (:movStatusKey is null or m.status.key = :movStatusKey)                   			\n")






I have included an attached .txt file with the details.
