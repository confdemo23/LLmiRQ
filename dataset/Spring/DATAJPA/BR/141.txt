JpaMetamodelEntityInformation cannot deal with mapped superclasses
Currently repository interfaces cannot be used with a @MappedSuperclass annotated JPA entity class as we try to lookup an EntityType from the EntityManager&amp;apos;s Metamodel which MappedSuperclass aren&amp;apos;t. We should rather use .managedType() and see if it implements IdentitifiedType to look for id information.
