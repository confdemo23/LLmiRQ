PersistenceProvider enum should also match org.hibernate.jpa.HibernateEntityManager
With Hibernate 4.3 the package for HibernateEntityManager changed to org.hibernate.jpa.HibernateEntityManager.
The lack of support for the new location leads to a QueryCreationException because of an erroneous fallback to GENERIC_JPA which sets canExtractQuery() to false.
PersistenceProvider should also match the new location to HIBERNATE or a new enum value which returns true for canExtractQuery().
