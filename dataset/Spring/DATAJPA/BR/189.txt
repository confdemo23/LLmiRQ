MergingPersistenceUnitManager potentially adds classes multiple times
MergingPersistenceUnitManager does not guard against the the new PUI&amp;apos;s root URL bing equivalent to the old ones. In this case the old PUIs root URL gets added to the list of JAR file URLs but does not get removed as root URL which might cause persistence providers (e.g. Hibernate) cause complaining about duplicate entries.
