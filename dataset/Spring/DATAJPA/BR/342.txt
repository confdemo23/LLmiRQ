Wrong calculation of total number of elements when using DISTINCT clause
If I define a custom query of this type:






@Query("SELECT DISTINCT m.genre FROM Media m WHERE m.user = ?1 ORDER BY m.genre ASC")




Page&lt;String&gt; getJukeGenres(User user, Pageable pageable);






The resulting Page element has wrong Total Elements.
It seems like it gives the number of total records instead of the distinct ones.
I had to create another adhoc query just to have the correct count:






@Query("SELECT count(*) as num FROM Media m WHERE m.user = ?1 AND m.genre IS NOT NULL")




long countGenres(User user);






But this is tedious workaround that I would like to avoid
