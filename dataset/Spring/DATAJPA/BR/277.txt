Pageable sorting by join property excludes null matches with Specifications
If you have a repository that extends JpaSpecficationExecutor and use the findAll method with a Specification, the resulting query excludes null matches from the result.  This may be related to issue DATAJPA-252.
I&amp;apos;ve attached a test case that demonstrates how DATAJPA-252 is fixed but this is still an issue.
