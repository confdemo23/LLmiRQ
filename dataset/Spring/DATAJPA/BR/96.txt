Invalid use of part.getProperty().toDotPath() in JpaQueryCreator
As explained in great details in the forum (see reference). Short Summary: 
All usages of part.getProperty().toDotPath() in JpaQueryCreator are invalid because the persistence provider expects single attributes and not object graphs as input of get() method.
Happens with LIKE, NOT_LIKE, BETWEEN and perhaps in other places too.
