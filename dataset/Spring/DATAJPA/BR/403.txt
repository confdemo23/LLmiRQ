Unnecessary OUTER JOIN are generated when sorting on ElementCollection
Extending JpaSpecificationExecutor and calling findAll with a Specification and a Sort cause unnecessary outer join to be add to the query generating wrong results with duplicate data.
This happens if the Specification queries on a field of an object mapped by and @ElementCollection and sort by another field of the same object.
Not sure if the problem in SimpleJpaRepository or in QueryUtils, but somewhere new outer join is created while an existing one could be reuse.
The following query is generated






SELECT




    entitya0_.id AS id1_0_




FROM




    entity_a entitya0_




LEFT OUTER JOIN




    entity_b entitiesb1_




ON




    entitya0_.id=entitiesb1_.entity_a_id




LEFT OUTER JOIN




    entity_b entitiesb2_




ON




    entitya0_.id=entitiesb2_.entity_a_id




WHERE




    entitiesb1_.field=?




ORDER BY




    entitiesb2_.rank DESC






The expected query looks like






SELECT




    entitya0_.id AS id1_0_




FROM




    entity_a entitya0_




LEFT OUTER JOIN




    entity_b entitiesb1_




ON




    entitya0_.id=entitiesb1_.entity_a_id




WHERE




    entitiesb1_.field=?




ORDER BY




    entitiesb1_.rank DESC
