Executing a Specification with fetch-joins leads to wrong HQL query
IS
Calling the mentioned method with a Specification which contains fetches only will lead to an added join clause for the entity used within the sort declaration. This leads to the following exception: 






org.springframework.dao.InvalidDataAccessApiUsageException: org.hibernate.QueryException: query specified join fetching, but the owner of the fetched association was not present in the select list






SHOULD
The mentioned method should not add a join clause to the Root as there is already a suitable fetch join.
HINTS
This behaviour cannot be reproduced in spring-data-jpa Version 1.2.0
