AuthorizationServerBeanDefinitionParser does not inject authorization code services ref correctly
Line 115 of AuthorizationServerBeanDefinitionParser.java (https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-security-oauth/blob/master/spring-security-oauth2/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/oauth2/config/AuthorizationServerBeanDefinitionParser.java) looks for an XML attribute on the authorization-code element named "services-ref" for the AuthorizationCodeServices bean reference. The Oauth2 xsd file (http://www.springframework.org/schema/security/spring-security-oauth2.xsd) defines an attribute named "authorization-code-services-ref" instead. The two attribute names should match. I suggest using "authorization-code-services-ref", as defined in the .xsd, since it is more complete, and changing the line in AuthorizationServerBeanDefinitionParser.java to look for that name instead of "services-ref".
