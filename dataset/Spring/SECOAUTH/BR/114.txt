Weblogic does not allow repeat execution of filter chain
Weblogic does not allow repeat execution of filter chain, so OAuth2ClientContextFilter doesn&amp;apos;t work (http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?113899-Broken-Filter-Chain-in-WebLogic-in-OAuth2ClientContextFilter).  There doesn&amp;apos;t seem to be any way round this other than a re-design, if possible, of the client interceptor features.  The filter chain is only repeated when a new access token is acquired, so my guess is we could move that recovery down the stack into the OAuth2RestTemplate itself somehow.
