Incorrect error reporting during user authorization
When client_id is not found, Auth server first allows user to log in (which is IMHO not necessary), then reports an error to the client as a JSON object.
Instead, it must redirect back to the client through redirection URI (if provided) with error code and description in query parameters (see http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-10#section-3.2).
If the redirecition URI is not provided in the request, since the client is unknown, the Auth server can display an error page, though it&amp;apos;s not described in draft 10. Anyway, sending JSON to an end-user under web-server profile is not good.
