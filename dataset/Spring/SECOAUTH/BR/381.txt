User&apos;s password gets serialized in authentication column if password grant type is used
If a user requests an access token using the password grant authorization flow, their password is stored in the clear in the database by JdbcTokenStore. This should also affect any other token store.
When the OAuth2Authentication object is being serialized, it&amp;apos;s authorizationRequest contains a map of authorization parameters. This will contain the scope, the grant_type, the username, and the password. The password should be removed before serializing to any store. Otherwise the user&amp;apos;s password is leaked. This is worse than exposing tokens in the database since passwords may be used across sites.
