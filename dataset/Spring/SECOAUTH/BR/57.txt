UserAuthorizationProcessingFilter not defaulting to URL /oauth_authenticate_token
UserAuthorizationProcessingFilter has an incorrect constructor.  Currently, it requires a parameter "s", but the constructor should be empty and should be passing super("/oauth_authenticate_token"), instead of super(s).  As a result, the default URL is not being set for this filter.  You can see the method getDefaultFilterProcessesUrl which does have the proper URL is never being called also. 
The workaround is to make sure to add authenticate-token-url="/oauth_authenticate_token" to the provider xml element.
