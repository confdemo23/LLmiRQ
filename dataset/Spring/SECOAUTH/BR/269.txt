OAuth2Exception is not really an AuthenticationException
OAuth2Exception is not really an AuthenticationException and this causes problems with webapp clients because they tend to redirect to a login page on an AuthenticationException, whereas the user is probably already authenticated, so this leads to confusion (and lack of clarity about what the problem actually is).
