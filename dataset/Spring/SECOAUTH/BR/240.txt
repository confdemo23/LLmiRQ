Wrong error for access token request when using a bad client_secret
Request an access token using client_credentials grant_type, using an invalid client secret;
Expected result should be HTTP 401, and error code should be "invalid_client", instead I get
HTTP 401 (which is correct) but error code is "unauthorized". This behavior seam to be introduced when the DefaultWebResponseExceptionTranslator refactor was made.
Here is what happens "internally" in case it helps:
AbstractUserDetailsAuthenticationProvider-&gt;authenticate-&gt;additionalAuthenticationChecks -&gt; throws BadCredentialsException which is not a OAuth2Exception, but it is an AuthenticationException which gets mapped by the WebResponseExceptionTranslator to "unauthorized".
