AccessTokenProcessingFilter validates additional parameters in wrong method
AccessTokenProcessingFilter validates if the token is null and the 1.0a parameters in the validateOAuthParams.  While they are oAuth params, it makes things easier in subclasses if these validations were put in validateAdditionalParameters and the validateOAuthParams were reserved for common oauth params amongst all filters, perhaps even changing the validateOAuthParams method to private to prevent overriding it.  Any additional validation can then occur in the validateAdditionalParameters method.
