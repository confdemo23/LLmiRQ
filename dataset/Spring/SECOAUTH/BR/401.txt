ResourceBeanDefinitionParser does not handle "password" grant type
Part of the problem is described here:
http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?129962-bug-in-resource-owner-password-credentials-flow&amp;highlight=Unable+obtain+access+token+resource
Additional problems when type="password":

The userAuthorizationUri property is erroneously required
The username and password properties are not applied

While it may be true that XML-configured resources of type "password" have limited practical utility, the XSD (spring-security-oauth2-1.0.xsd) does state support for the "password" grant type.
