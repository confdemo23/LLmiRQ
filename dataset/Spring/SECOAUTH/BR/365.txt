OAuth2ClientContextFilter does not store REAL current uri
the current uri that is created and stored by the filter is not the exact uri used in the request.
1.) if the code parameter is not the first parameter in the request it will result in a "&amp;&amp;" entry in the created uri
2.) the ordering of parameters that is returned by request.getParameterNames() is not the same ordering as it is in the request uri. this results in a "wrong" ordering in the created current-uri.
I&amp;apos;m not sure if this is a jetty issue but this way the created current-uri can not be used to exchange auth codes with certain oauth2 providers (for example Facebook).
