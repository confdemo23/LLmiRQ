HttpSessionAccessTokenCache does not create a session
HttpSessionOAuth2RememberMeServices.preserveState() and rememberTokens() fail to save anything if there is no HTTP session. This is contrary to the interface contract. I think the session should be created in this case (possibly as configurable behaviour, but with this default).
This is similar to how HttpSessionSecurityContextRepository works.
(BTW, a "token repository" or something would be a better name for this class than "RememberMeServices", which remind of the unrelated remember-me functionality for web logins.)
