No response parameter for scope when using implicit grant (and scopes are different than requested)
According to RFC 6749 Section 4.2.2, the scope response parameter is a required parameter if the granted scopes are different than those requested. However, looking at the AuthorizationEndpoint.appendAccessToken in the 1.0.2.RELEASE, the scope parameter is never appended to the redirect URL.
