2-Legged authentication fails when token="" is present in the signature
Recently while impplementing the 2-legged authentication using consumerkey and consumer secret, came across the issue where
if we specify an empty token in the Oauth header , the authentication fails.
However if we remove the token="" altogether, everything works fine as expected.
I put a fix in the following location to get around this issue as some oauth clients still produce token="" in the oauth header.
spring-security-oauth/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/oauth/provider/ProtectedResourceProcessingFilter.java
In the method
protected void onValidSignature(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, FilterChain chain) throws IOException, ServletException 
Changed 
if (token != null) {
to
if (token != null &amp;&amp; !"".equals(token)) {
Thanks
