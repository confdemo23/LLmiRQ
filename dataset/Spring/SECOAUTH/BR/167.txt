Token Service default in <authorization-server/> incorrect
If a token-services-ref is not provided in the authorization-server definition, the value appears to be defaulted to an instance of a token store instead being defaulted with an instance of a token service. This results in the bean definition failing to initialize.
Workaround is to initialize the auth-server with a token services bean.
