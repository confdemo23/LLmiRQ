setExipiration() bug in deserializeAccessToken() in class DefaultOAuth2SerializationService
In the method deserializeAccessToken() in the class DefaultOAuth2SerializationService line 86 is as follows:
token.setExpiration(new Date(expiration * 1000L));
The expiration variable being deserialized is the number of seconds from the current time until expiration and thus the line should be:
token.setExpiration(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() + expiration * 1000L));
Either that or just serialize the time it expires directly and not time until expiration?
With this bug, all access tokens acquired from the provider have an incorrect expiration date.
