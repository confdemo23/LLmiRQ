Certain characters in signature are not validating properly
There seems to be an issue where certain characters in the signature are creating validation to fail.  Here is an example (using HMAC-SHA1 for signature method):
Signature as generated on the consumer side (using CoreOAuthConsumerSupport to make the call): KoCR1Z1PeM/+sCoptySENMEh2xw=
Signature as generated on the provider side: KoCR1Z1PeM/ sCoptySENMEh2xw=
Notice how the + is missing on the provider side.  My guess is this has something to do with URLEncoding/Decoding.  This is difficult to replicate since the signature needs a + sign in it after generation.
