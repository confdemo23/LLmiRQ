Duplicate Key when creating new access_token
the bug could be easily reproduce by these steps:
1.user grant client with an access token Aa and refresh_token Ra
2.waiting for Aa to be expired(at the time Ra is not expired)
3.user grant client with another access token Ab and refresh_token Rb(the RandomValueTokenServices automatic delete the expire access token Aa,but leave Ra in TokenStore)
at here,we got 1 access token Ab and two refresh_token Ra Rb
4.client refresh access token with Ra(a client could be running on several device such as app on iTouch and iPhone,they hold different refresh token)
if there is a uniq index on authentication_id ,we got exception,or go on with 5
5.and now TokenStore will get 2 access token with same authentication_id
6.when calling JdbcTokenStore&amp;apos;s getAccessToken(OAuth2Authentication authentication) will get exception.
