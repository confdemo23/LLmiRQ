Auth code grant overwrites requested scopes in token endpoint
The token endpoint does not accept a scope= parameter in general from the client during an auth code grant, but it still uses it if there, and (worse) the default auth request factory overwrites the existing value if the input has no explicit scope.  This means that the client actually must supply scope parameter to the token endpoint where actually it should be ignored (I suspect).
