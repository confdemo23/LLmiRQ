InMemoryTokenStore can be internally inconsistent if user account is deleted and re-created
InMemoryTokenStore can be internally inconsistent if user account is deleted and re-created.  The access tokens are stored in a has keyed on a key generated from the authentication, but the key could stay the same when a user account changes (e.g. deleted and re-created and a primary key changes).  And the authentications are stored in a has keyed on the access token value.  The two stores can become inconsistent resulting in strange looking 403 errors.
