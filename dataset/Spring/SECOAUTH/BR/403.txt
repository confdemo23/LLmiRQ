DefaultRedirectResolver throws wrong exceptions
The OAuth 2.0 spec (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) indicates an "unauthorized_client" error should be returned when "the authenticated client is not authorized to use this authorization grant type." For redirection URI mismatch, "invalid_request" should be the error code. There is no error code called "redirect_uri_mismatch."
