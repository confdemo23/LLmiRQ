OAuth2ClientTokenServices do not store tokens for the null authentication
InMemoryOAuth2ClientTokenServices does not store tokens for the null authentication. It just does nothing, and get() returns null for it. As a result, a token that is not associated with a Spring Security user is never remembered, and needs to be fetched from the provider each time (cf SECOAUTH-151).
