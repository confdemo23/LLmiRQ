Extending SpringBootRepositoryRestMvcConfiguration removes jacksonObjectMapper bean
I have an application where I am auto-wiring ObjectMapper as 






@Autowired




@Qualifier("jacksonObjectMapper")




private ObjectMapper mapper;






If I create a class (with empty body even), which extends SpringBootRepositoryRestMvcConfiguration, this code breaks, because there is no jacksonObjectMapper bean. There are other ObjectMapper instances, but they behave differently. Extending a class should not change the applications behavior.
