Make sure @Bean methods of RepositoryRestMvcConfiguration are called from proxied methods
Some methods in RepositoryRestMvcConfiguration are private but call @Bean annotated methods in turn. These method calls will not get intercepted correctly as private methods are not intercepted by the CGLib generated subtype of the configuration class. That means that @Bean methods called from the private methods will not be routed through the interceptor and thus Spring&amp;apos;s bean management (scopes, invocation of callbacks) will not be applied.
