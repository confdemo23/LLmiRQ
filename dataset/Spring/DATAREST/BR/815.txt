HAL browser redirect fails when proxied through Zuul
I have an app called viewer with little more than @SpringBootApplication &amp; @EnableEurekaClient that has spring-data-rest-hal-browser:2.5.1.RELEASE on it&amp;apos;s classpath, along with spring cloud Brixton.RC2 dependencies. application.yml only holds the spring.application.name, no context-path. This app connects to a eureka instance and is routed through a Zuul proxy, both also running Brixton.RC2. The Zuul proxy automatically routes /viewer to the backend service.
When I open the root URL from whatever port the viewer app is running on, I&amp;apos;m correctly redirected to /browser/index.html#.
When I open the root URL through my separate Zuul proxy, I&amp;apos;m again redirected to /browser/index.html#, but that fails because the /viewer x-forwarded-prefix header is ignored. Here&amp;apos;s a sample response from the actuator /trace page:

As you can see the Location header does not include the /viewer prefix. Opening /viewer/browser/index.html#/ directly works as expected.
