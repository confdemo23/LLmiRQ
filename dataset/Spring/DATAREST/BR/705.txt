Cannot PUT versioned entity returned by spring-data-rest
I would expect it to be possible to execute PUT by simply supplying all fields returned by GET. However, this is currently broken as a consequence of DATAREST-160. 
Now when an entity is exposed via REST API (either as part of a list, or directly), it&amp;apos;s returned without version property. However, when PUT operation is performed, version property can be required, since the whole entity is persisted (as opposed to PATCH logic where only changed fields need to be supplied). This is true, for example, for JPA, which will check version and refuse updating if version is missing.
This means that REST API client is expected to send a property that it never received. In fact, the client might not even be aware that such property exists, how it&amp;apos;s called, and what value it should contain.
