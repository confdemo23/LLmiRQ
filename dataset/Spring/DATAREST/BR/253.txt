AssociationOmittingSerializerModifier suffers from potential NullPointerException
AssociationOmittingSerializerModifier traverses the properties Jackson detected and checks whether they&amp;apos;re associations. For properties not backed by a field at all (i.e. getters that represent a calculated business value) the PersistentProperty will be null and the subsequent if-clauses will cause a NullPointerException.
