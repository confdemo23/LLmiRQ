Repository controllers not invoked if resource is handled manually in dedicated media type
I have a Spring Data REST project. For some URLs I want to create a @Controller that renders the resources as HTML. I am using a @RequestMapping with produces = MediaType.TEXT_HTML_VALUE. In fact this controller is called if the URL is requested. However, if I do a request for JSON I get a 406 - while in fact the Spring Data REST controller should be called. I noticed that the log output says that the Spring Data REST controller doesn&amp;apos;t register with any value for produces.
I think a value for produces should be given. Maybe there is a way to do this but I didn&amp;apos;t find it in the reference documentation. Maybe there are other ways to get different representations of the REST resources but that doesn&amp;apos;t seem to be documented either. I guess different representations for the same resource are an important part of REST so I think there should be a way to do what I want to do.
