Nested entities are replaced with new instances instead of being updated when merging
When using the repository domain object update end point (via the PATCH method with JSON data), nested objects are replaced with new instances instead of updates being applied to the existing instance.
For example, given these classes:











@JsonAutoDetect(fieldVisibility = Visibility.ANY)




static class Outer {









	String name;




	String prop;




	Inner inner;




}









@JsonAutoDetect(fieldVisibility = Visibility.ANY)




static class Inner {









	String name;




	String prop;




}






Let there be an instance of Outer like this:






Inner inner = new Inner();




inner.name = "inner name";




inner.prop = "something";




Outer outer = new Outer();




outer.prop = "else";




outer.name = "outer name";




outer.inner = inner;






Then make an HTTP PATCH request to update that object with this request body:






{ "inner" : { "name" : "new inner name" } }






the resulting Outer object should have inner.prop="something" but inner.prop is actually null.
