UriStringDeserializer should guard against URI templates submitted
Currently UriStringDeserializer uses the raw String provided for the value and tries to create a URI instance from it. In case the client accidentally submits a URI tempalte, this will fail.
The UriStringDeserializer should defensively expand the given value to make sure optional template variables are stripped.
