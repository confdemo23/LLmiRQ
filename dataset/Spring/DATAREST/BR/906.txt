MappingAwarePageableArgumentResolver accidentally drops default Pageable returned from delegate PageableHandlerMethodArgumentResolver
After upgrading to spring-boot 1.4.1 which includes Hopper-SR3 I get a NPE in the following code section when Pageable is not set explicitly:
public Page&lt;Translation&gt; findTranslationsBy(String isoCode, Pageable pageable) 
{

    log.info("" + pageable.getPageSize());

    ....

}

Setting HOPPER-SR2 in pom.xml fixes the problem as a default page-size is taken into account.
