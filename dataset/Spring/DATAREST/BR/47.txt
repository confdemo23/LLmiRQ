POST fails, when links : null
Since the last update fixing the update problem with links, there is a new error. Doing a POST with empty links results in a:
org.springframework.http.converter.HttpMessageNotReadableException: Property &amp;apos;links&amp;apos; is not of array type. Either eliminate this property from the document or make it an array.
Adding the links like this: 
entity.setLinks(new ArrayList&lt;LinkType&gt;());
and it works, without any issues. 
From my point of view it should also work with Links : null.
