Invalid JSON Schema for properties pointing to association resources
I am using a Spring Data REST version of Spring Boot&amp;apos;s PetClinic application for playing around with the JSON Schema support. I noticed the following:
A property which represents a one-to-many association is of type string and format uri. However, it also contains the properties uniqueItems and items, which, according to the JSON Schema validation docs, only exist for array types. Below is an excerpt of the JSON Schema for the Owner class:






{




  "title": "Owner",




  "properties": {




    "pets": {




      "title": "Pets",




      "readOnly": false,




      "type": "string",




      "format": "uri",




      "uniqueItems": true,




      "items": {




        "type": "object"




      }




    },




    ...




  }




}






I think the correct representation would be the following, do you agree?






{




  "title": "Owner",




  "properties": {




    "pets": {




      "title": "Pets",




      "readOnly": false,




      "type": "array",




      "uniqueItems": true,




      "items": {




        "type": "string",




        "format": "uri"




      }




    },




    ...




  }




}
