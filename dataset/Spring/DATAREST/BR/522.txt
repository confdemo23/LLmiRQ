GET on RestRepository not possible, if a RestController for the same path is available
We have a Spring Data REST project, with several @RepositoryRestResource annotated Spring Data Repositories.
Example: 






PersonRepository.java






@RepositoryRestResource(path = "person")




public interface PersonRepository extends PagingAndSortingRepository&lt;Person, Integer&gt; {}






We want to override the POST/PATCH method of one of these repositories. So we annotate a RestController with @RestController and the annotation @RequestMapping has the same path as the repository.
Example: 






PersonController.java






@RestController




@RequestMapping("person")




public class PersonController{









	@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST, produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)




	public ResponseEntity&lt;Boolean&gt; savePerson(@RequestBody Person person) {




...




}






The POST/PATCH works fine. But now a GET to /person (to receive all Persons) throws an HttpRequestMethodNotSupportedException and says: Request method &amp;apos;GET&amp;apos; not supported.
A GET to /person/1 instead is working just fine. 
We had a look at https://jira.spring.io/browse/DATAREST-490 and the @BasePathAwareController, but this doesnt seem to change anything.
