Make old presentation available for smooth migration to HAL
For people using SD Rest a bit longer, the migration towards HAL could take some time. So I think there a many people, which would really appreciate the opportunity of a smooth migration by default enabling both, the old and the new representation.
That would help, to be able to get the bugfixes regarding SDF 4.0 and for example the previously filed sorting bug.
