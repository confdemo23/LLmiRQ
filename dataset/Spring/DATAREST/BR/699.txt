On Java 8, link templates to search resources using pagination contain pageable variable
When using Java 8 with parameter name discovery added, the links pointing to search methods using a Pageable contain a pageable URI template variable. This is caused by the RepositoryMethodResourceMapping only dropping parameters without names (assuming Pageable and Sort were never annotated with @Param).
We should explicitly exclude parameters of these types from being exposed as explicit search method parameters.
