PUT empties nested collection
In the following scenario Parent and Child are entities and Item is either a Embeddable or an Entity. Only Parent has a repository that is also exported.

Posting such a structure works fine but the PUT empties the Item collection in Child. 
Please see this project to reproduce the issue - https://github.com/mduesterhoeft/sdr-put-nested-list.
Such a scenario has been working in Hopper-SR4 and started to be broken since Hopper-SR5.

Here are the requests I am issuing:

Create parent






POST /parents -&gt; 201




{




    "child": {




        "items": [




          {"some": "test"}]




    }




}






update parent






PUT /parents/id -&gt; 204




{




    "child": {




        "items": [




          {"some": "test123"} ]




    }




}







After the PUT the items collection is empty.
