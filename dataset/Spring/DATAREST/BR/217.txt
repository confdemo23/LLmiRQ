Crud or PagingAndSorting based repository entites still listed when findAll method is &apos;exported = false&apos;
When a @RestResource(exported = false) annotation is placed against the appropriate (highest level of functionality) findAll() method, all entities are still shown in the REST JSON response.
Example:






@Override




@RestResource(exported = false)




Page&lt;Person&gt; findAll(Pageable pageable);
