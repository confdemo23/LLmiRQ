RepositoryPropertyReferenceController.createPropertyReference() does not work for empty content supplied on Spring 4.1
Spring 4.1&amp;apos;s RequestResponseBodyMethodProcessor rejects a request with an empty payload if a parameter annotated with @RequestBody is not configured to required = true. Even in this case it forcibly returns null so that a HandlerMethodArgumentResolver that could even deal with an empty payload is not even invoked.
We need to switch to required = false to not run into the rejection and manually default the Resources&lt;Object&gt; in case it&amp;apos;s null
