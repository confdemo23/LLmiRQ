@JsonUnwrapped annotation ignored
Using Spring Boot 1.4.0, Spring Data REST no longer seems to take the @JsonUnwrapped annotation into account to unwrap entities in the JSON responses. The previous Spring Boot versions (i.c. 1.3.7) does not have this problem.
It can be easily reproduced on the master branch of the RestBucks project. When you PUT a payment for an order, the credit card number should be unwrapped, since it is annotated with @JsonUnwrapped, but it is not:






{




  "amount": "EUR4.20",




  "creditCard": {




    "number": {




      "number": "1234123412341234"




    },




    "cardHolderName": "Oliver Gierke",




    "expirationDate": "2099-12-01"




  },




  "_links": {




    "restbucks:order": {




      "href": "http://localhost:8080/orders/1{?projection}",




      "templated": true,




      "title": "An order"




    },




    "curies": [




      {




        "href": "http://localhost:8080/docs/{rel}.html",




        "name": "restbucks",




        "templated": true




      }




    ]




  }




}






The expected output would be (if the @JsonUnwrapped annotation was parsed correctly):






{




  "amount": "EUR4.20",




  "creditCard": {




    "number": "1234123412341234",




    "cardHolderName": "Oliver Gierke",




    "expirationDate": "2099-12-01"




  },




  "_links": {




    "restbucks:order": {




      "href": "http://localhost:8080/orders/1{?projection}",




      "templated": true,




      "title": "An order"




    },




    "curies": [




      {




        "href": "http://localhost:8080/docs/{rel}.html",




        "name": "restbucks",




        "templated": true




      }




    ]




  }




}






This looks like a Spring Data REST bug. Spring Boot 1.3.x uses Spring Data Gosling and @JsonUnwrapped works as expected. However if spring-data-releasetrain.version is overriden to use Spring Data Hopper @JsonUnwrapped no longer works. You can see this behaviour if you check out and run this commit in RestBucks.
