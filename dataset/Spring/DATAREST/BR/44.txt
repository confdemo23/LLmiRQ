Issue on Entity without @Version attribute when using Eclipselink as provider
If using EclipseLink as persistence provider, the exporter fails with this error:
"java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No @Version attribute exists on the identifiable type"
I have isolated the error at line 35 of JpaEntityMetadata class, seems that the metod entityType.getVersion(Long.class) fails in eclipselink if no @Version is defined.
