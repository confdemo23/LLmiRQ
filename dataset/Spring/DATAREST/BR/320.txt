Fields with @JsonProperty are ignored on serialization
Field annotated with @JsonProperty are left out from the serialization. This also means that it is not possible to alter the json property name. 
The problem seems to be caused by 





PersistentEntityJackson2Module.updateBuilder(..)





 on line #219, where the property is attempted looked up by the name from the @JsonProperty, instead of the "real" property name. One way I think this can be solved is to add an inner loop to find the internal name from beanDesc.findProperties().
Example:






@Entity




public class Description {    




    private String heading;




    @JsonProperty("body")




    private String content;




    ...




}






On serialization, everything looks fine from Jackson&amp;apos;s perspective, but when the updateBuilder() hook on PersistentEntityJackson2Module is called the content property is omitted because the name of the field is different from the @JsonProperty.
I haven&amp;apos;t sent a pull request, since I haven&amp;apos;t enlisted in the contributor program, but hopefully you can cherry pick or look at the commit on my fork.
This problem was also described in DATAREST-117 and the corresponding pull request that was never merged: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-rest/pull/136.
