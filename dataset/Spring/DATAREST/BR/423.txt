Spring Data REST registered ConversionService not used when overriding individual resources
I have a business object User and in my application I have to set property active to false when deleting User.
I don&amp;apos;t want to expose my business logic on REST model so I wanted to override DELETE /user/{id} behavior to patch user to set active to false.
In order to achieve that I write my own controller with following piece of code:






@RepositoryRestController




@ResponseBody




@RequestMapping("/users")




public class UserController {









    @Inject




    private UserService userService;









    @ResponseStatus(value = HttpStatus.NO_CONTENT)




    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.DELETE, value = "/{user}")




    public void delete(@PathVariable("user") User user) {




        user.setActive(false);




        userService.save(user);




    }




}






Method is correctly called but I get an org.springframework.beans.ConversionNotSupportedException...
So I tried to add a custom converter (String -&gt; User) like describe here: http://docs.spring.io/spring-data/rest/docs/1.1.0.M1/reference/htmlsingle/#d4e110
But the converter is never called.
When debugging I saw that https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/master/spring-beans/src/main/java/org/springframework/beans/TypeConverterDelegate.java#L169 is NULL that why my converter is not called.
I will try to find more and create PR if possible but atm I don&amp;apos;t have more information.
