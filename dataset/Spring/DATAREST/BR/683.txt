ALPS profile does not reflect jackson customization (e.g. enableEnumTranslation=true)
Found while trying to document the enums of my REST API with ALPS.
See example including failing test here: https://github.com/otrosien/spring-alps-bug
The alps profile starts like below, but seems like it uses a differently configured jackson mapper, as the main one is configured to "enableEnumTranslation" ("Payment expected" instead of "PAYMENT_EXPECTED").






{




  "version" : "1.0",




  "descriptors" : [ {




    "id" : "order-representation",




    "href" : "http://localhost/profile/orders",




    "descriptors" : [ {




      "name" : "status",




      "doc" : {




        "value" : "PAYMENT_EXPECTED, PAID",




        "format" : "TEXT"




      },




      "type" : "SEMANTIC"




    } ]
