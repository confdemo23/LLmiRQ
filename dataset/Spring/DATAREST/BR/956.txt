PUT does not apply new items in nested collection
In the following scenario Parent and Child are entities and Item is either a Embeddable or an Entity. Only Parent has a repository that is also exported.

PUT updates existing items but does not add new items.
Please see this project to reproduce the issue - https://github.com/mduesterhoeft/sdr-put-nested-list. See test ParentRestIntegrationTest#should_add_new_item

Here are the requests I am issuing:

Create parent






POST /parents -&gt; 201




{




    "child": {




        "items": [




          {"some": "test"}]




    }




}






update parent






PUT /parents/id -&gt; 204




{




    "child": {




        "items": [




          {"some": "test123"},




          {"some": "test1235"}]




    }




}







After the PUT the items collection still has size 1.
