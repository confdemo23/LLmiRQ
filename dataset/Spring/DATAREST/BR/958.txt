PUT of Document with List<> fails to add entries post Hopper-SR5+
As demonstrated in the following project:

https://github.com/timtebeek/mongo-datarest-put-nested
https://travis-ci.org/timtebeek/mongo-datarest-put-nested

I use Spring Data Mongo with Spring Data Rest.

POST object with a single element in an array
PUT to the resulting url an updated object with two elements in array
GET the resulting url and inspect the array
https://github.com/timtebeek/mongo-datarest-put-nested/blob/master/src/test/java/com/github/timtebeek/PetProjectTest.java#L23

Under Hopper-SR4 the array is updated to now contain two elements.
Under Hopper-SR5 the array only contains the original single element.
This seems like a regression and breaks our application, leaving us stuck on Hopper-SR4 for now. Can you confirm and fix this please?
