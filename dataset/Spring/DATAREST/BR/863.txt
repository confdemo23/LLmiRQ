REST calls to /api always redirect to HAL Browser if no accept header is specified
After updating 2 projects to Spring Boot 1.4 (and Spring Data Rest 2.5.2) all REST calls to /api  that don&amp;apos;t specify a header like "accept: application/json" redirect to /api/browser/index.html#/api/. In previous versions this was only the case when the accept header was text/html, but now the redirect happens with empty accept header.
This may have nothing to do with Spring Data Rest directly, I just put it here because HAL Browser is involved.
But as a result, the default HAL browser itself cannot get the /api and shows its own index.html.
