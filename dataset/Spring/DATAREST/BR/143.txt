Hi Jon,
when I am doing a put to the self link with embedded links I get an error. This means I need to remove all links before putting an element. I think this should not be the desired behaviour. Or?
Sample:






{




   "description":"adasdadsasdads",




   "name":"Customer Corp",




   "links":[




      {




         "rel":"self",




         "href":"http://localhost:8080/web/api/customer/1"




      },




      {




         "rel":"customer.customer.users",




         "href":"http://localhost:8080/web/api/customer/1/users"




      },




      {




         "rel":"customer.customer.credentials",




         "href":"http://localhost:8080/web/api/customer/1/credentials"




      },




      {




         "rel":"customer.customer.addresses",




         "href":"http://localhost:8080/web/api/customer/1/addresses"




      },




      {




         "rel":"customer.customer.sector",




         "href":"http://localhost:8080/web/api/customer/1/sector"




      }




   ]




}






The response is:






javascript




{




  "cause" : null,




  "message" : "Property &amp;apos;links&amp;apos; not found for entity de.model.customer.Customer"




}






Perhaps one additional note: the same happens, when using embedded entities like you described here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12879975/spring-data-rest-uri-vs-entity-id. Of course the POST fails, if I remove the links as the exporter is not able to find the customer in the database.
