Add means to prefer deleting by object instead of deleting by id
From the REST interface to the Repository you cannot force preference for using the void delete(T t) method over void delete(ID id) method. As a result we cannot do @PreAuthorize filters on delete based of object values. A use case for this would be to set security constraints.
