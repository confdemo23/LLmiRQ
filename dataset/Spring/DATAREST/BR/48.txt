Executing /search/findEntityById?id=823892389 with x-spring-data-compact+json does not return any value.
When I try to execute a search with the following URL: 
http://localhorst:8080/rest/entity/search/findEntityById?id=823892389 setting Accept : application/x-spring-data-compact+json the result is:
{
  "links" : [ ],
  "content" : [ ]
}
Doing the exactly same request with 
Accept : application/json returns
{
  "links" : [ ],
  "content" : [ {
    "links" : [  
{
      "rel" : "self",
      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/rest/entity/453234243"
    }
,  ],
    "enabled" : false,
    ....
  } ]
}
In the previous build it worked.
