Collection references are removed on PUT and PATCH if defaulted to empty collections
Whenever a PUT or PATCH is performed, the DomainObjectMerger erases the objects references/associations if not null on the "from" object. In our case of one-to-many, we initialize those variable to empty arrays so they are never null unless explicitly set so. I&amp;apos;m curious as to why the DomainObjectMerger even would attempt to merge associations? Is it possible to send associations in the same payload as the aggregate root object? If so, then i could see why it would do so, but if not, then what is the point?
Work around for now is to not default association values to empty collections.
