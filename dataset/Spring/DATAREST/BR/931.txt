PATCH for non-resource associations doesn&apos;t work as expected
User has a repository and Phone has not. [id and some other fields are pruned in below examples for brevity, see full entities in example code]






@Entity




public class User {









        private String name;









	@Column(nullable = false)




	@Temporal(value = TemporalType.TIMESTAMP)




	private Calendar creationDate;









	@OneToMany(mappedBy = "user", cascade = CascadeType.ALL)




	private List&lt;Phone&gt; phones;




}









@Entity




public class Phone extends BaseEntity {









	@Column(nullable = false)




	@Temporal(value = TemporalType.TIMESTAMP)




	private Calendar creationDate;









	@ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)




	private User user;




}






In this case patch for /users/1 with following data works:






{




   "name":"John Doe X",




   "phones":[




      {




         "id":1,




         "creationDate":"2016-11-02T07:34:02.806+0000",




         "label":"work",




         "number":"00000000"




      }




   ]




}






but following data fails with not-null-constraint error for creationDate:






{




   "name":"John Doe X",




   "phones":[




      {




         "id":1,




         "label":"work",




         "number":"00000000"




      }




   ]




}






PATCH works selectively on resources however doesn&amp;apos;t work as expected for inline data which is not a resource (in this case "phone")
