Sort mapping does not consider Jackson customizations in field names
Currently the Sort instance derived from an HTTP request gets the fields forwarded to the repository without any Jackson customizations (e.g. field name customizations) applied.
That means that although you might have customized the field name in the representation, the request parameter for the sort would still expose the underlying property names.
