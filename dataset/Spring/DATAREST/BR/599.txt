findBy + @Param expects an Id, which is not visible via REST
Hi,
here is another issue I came across while trying out Spring Data REST: 
IDs are, if I&amp;apos;m correct, intentionally not exposed in the resource body, as you&amp;apos;re supposed to use the URL as primary identifier. 
This is a problem, because by exposing a repository finder Spring Data REST expects me to put the primary key as query param.
I put up a small example on github:
https://github.com/otrosien/spring-data-examples/tree/findQueryParamMismatch
This is the interesting part: How am I, as REST client, suppose to fill the query param for customer1?






public interface RelationshipRepository extends PagingAndSortingRepository&lt;Relationship, Long&gt; {




 Page&lt;Relationship&gt; findByCustomer1(@Param("customer1") Customer customer1, Pageable pageable);
