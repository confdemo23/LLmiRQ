ResourceProcessor not used for nested Projection
There seems to be an issue with how ResourceProcessors are being applied to a Projection in certain case. I&amp;apos;ve linked to a repo that demonstrates the issue.
There are two entities, Person and Address. The Person is the parent in a @ManyToOne relationship to the Address. There is also a PersonProjection that shows a subset of the Person, most importantly it does not include the Set&lt;Address&gt; of the child Address entities. There is also a AddressProjection that includes the{{PersonProjection}} of the parent. The goal is to be able to retrieve the list of Address objects and their associated key Person information in a single call. 
Now, I also have ResourceProcessor implementations that add some links to each of the entities. That includes ResourceProcessor implementations on the projections. Everything works as described and expected when using the normal SDR endpoints to get the Person and Address collections. The custom links are correctly added to each entity. Also, when I query for the Person collection with the projection, that too adds the appropriate link to the Person representation. However, when I query the Address collection with the projection, the embedded PersonProjection has the normal SDR-generated links for self and the object itself person in this case, it does not have the custom links. 
The listing of the Person collection. Notice the google link, which is the custom link for this demonstration:






curl http://localhost:8080/persons; echo




{




  "_embedded" : {




    "persons" : [ {




      "firstName" : "Bob",




      "lastName" : "Bobby",




      "quote" : "Likes to Bob",




      "_links" : {




        "self" : {




          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/persons/1"




        },




        "person" : {




          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/persons/1{?projection}",




          "templated" : true




        },




        "google" : {




          "href" : "http://www.google.com"




        },




        "addresses" : {




          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/persons/1/addresses"




        }




      }




    } ]




  },




  "_links" : {




    "self" : {




      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/persons"




    },




    "profile" : {




      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/profile/persons"




    }




  },




  "page" : {




    "size" : 20,




    "totalElements" : 1,




    "totalPages" : 1,




    "number" : 0




  }




}






Now the listing of the Person collection with the projection enabled. Notice that the quote field is not returned, but the google link is still there.






curl http://localhost:8080/persons?projection=simple; echo




{




  "_embedded" : {




    "persons" : [ {




      "firstName" : "Bob",




      "lastName" : "Bobby",




      "_links" : {




        "self" : {




          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/persons/1"




        },




        "person" : {




          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/persons/1{?projection}",




          "templated" : true




        },




        "google" : {




          "href" : "http://www.google.com"




        },




        "addresses" : {




          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/persons/1/addresses"




        }




      }




    } ]




  },




  "_links" : {




    "self" : {




      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/persons"




    },




    "profile" : {




      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/profile/persons"




    }




  },




  "page" : {




    "size" : 20,




    "totalElements" : 1,




    "totalPages" : 1,




    "number" : 0




  }




}




{






The listing of the Address collection. Notice the microsoft link which is the custom link for this demonstration:






curl http://localhost:8080/addresses; echo




{




  "_embedded" : {




    "addresses" : [ {




      "line1" : "1234 Line 1 Street",




      "line2" : "Apt Line 2",




      "city" : "Somewhere",




      "state" : "NY",




      "country" : "USA",




      "zipcode" : "12345",




      "_links" : {




        "self" : {




          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/addresses/1"




        },




        "address" : {




          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/addresses/1{?projection}",




          "templated" : true




        },




        "microsoft" : {




          "href" : "http://www.microsoft.com"




        },




        "person" : {




          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/addresses/1/person"




        }




      }




    } ]




  },




  "_links" : {




    "self" : {




      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/addresses"




    },




    "profile" : {




      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/profile/addresses"




    }




  },




  "page" : {




    "size" : 20,




    "totalElements" : 1,




    "totalPages" : 1,




    "number" : 0




  }




}






And finally the listing of the Address projection, without the expected google link for the embedded Person. However, the Person is missing the quote field, so it is processing the rest of the projection.






curl http://localhost:8080/addresses?projection=simple; echo




{




  "_embedded" : {




    "addresses" : [ {




      "state" : "NY",




      "line" : "1234 Line 1 Street Apt Line 2",




      "city" : "Somewhere",




      "person" : {




        "firstName" : "Bob",




        "lastName" : "Bobby",




        "_links" : {




          "self" : {




            "href" : "http://localhost:8080/persons/1{?projection}",




            "templated" : true




          },




          "addresses" : {




            "href" : "http://localhost:8080/persons/1/addresses"




          }




        }




      },




      "zipcode" : "12345",




      "_links" : {




        "self" : {




          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/addresses/1"




        },




        "address" : {




          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/addresses/1{?projection}",




          "templated" : true




        },




        "microsoft" : {




          "href" : "http://www.microsoft.com"




        },




        "person" : {




          "href" : "http://localhost:8080/addresses/1/person"




        }




      }




    } ]




  },




  "_links" : {




    "self" : {




      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/addresses"




    },




    "profile" : {




      "href" : "http://localhost:8080/profile/addresses"




    }




  },




  "page" : {




    "size" : 20,




    "totalElements" : 1,




    "totalPages" : 1,




    "number" : 0




  }




}






It is not clear why the additional links are not being added. For all I can tell, it should be. There are no errors or warnings or any other indication of an issue that I can see.
