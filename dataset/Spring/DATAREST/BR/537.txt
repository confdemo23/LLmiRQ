Cannot remove an element of an array using JSON Patch request
The ||JsonPatchHandler}} applies a customization to remove operations. Instead of removing the node, it replace it with a null object. It works well for objects, but it doesn&amp;apos;t for elements of an array. The element won&amp;apos;t be removed from the array, instead it will be replaced with a null object.
I think if the path of the remove operation defines an element of an array, the original remove operation should be used instead of the customized ReplaceOperation.
