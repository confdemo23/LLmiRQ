Hal Browser does not seem to work with spring boot with a non-default context-path
if i have server.contextpath=foo in my application.properties 
and i go to localhost:8080/foo/ i am redirected to localhost:8080/browser/index.html which is 404. It if i navigate to: localhost:8080/foo/browser/index.html it also redirects me to that same place. 
Hal Browser needs to take context path into account.
