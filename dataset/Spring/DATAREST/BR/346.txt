ReflectionRepositoryInvoker doesn&apos;t apply conversion on invocation of an overridden delete() method
If a repository redeclares a delete() method using the concrete identifier type the ReflectionRepositoryInvoker fails to invoke this method as it will get the raw id value handed into the invokeDelete() method.
This is a side effect of the fix for DATAREST-335 which added explicit handling for the overridden method with the concrete identifier type but assumed the parameter would be handed in the correct type already.
