Finalizer hit db on lazy dbrefs
If we load a Document class that has a lazy annotated DBRef, and we do not navigate through it, the data is not requested to MongoDB as expected, but if we force a GC it seems that the proxy that envelops the attribute with DBRef generates a request to MongoDB.
You can see this issue in logs if trace logs are enabled:
Example to a DBRef to MY_DB.PEOPLE with id=18






2014-10-27 12:24:02.644  INFO 4384 --- [      Finalizer] com.mongodb.TRACE                        : find: MY_DB.PEOPLE { "_id" : 18}






And this is the trace I get debugging:






	at com.testapp.model.People$$EnhancerByCGLIB$$c7ff2ba0.finalize(&lt;generated&gt;)




	at java.lang.System$2.invokeFinalize(System.java:1267)




	at java.lang.ref.Finalizer.runFinalizer(Finalizer.java:98)




	at java.lang.ref.Finalizer.access$100(Finalizer.java:34)




	at java.lang.ref.Finalizer$FinalizerThread.run(Finalizer.java:210)






The problem seems to be at DefaultDbRefResolver creating the LazyLoadingInterceptor inner class.
