Querying criteria for "$in" on enum field gets lost in QueryMapper
As I was updating my project from M5 to GA, some of my tests started failing. It seemed that "$in" stopped working because I was getting an unfiltered result set back. I was able to trace the problem to QueryMapper.
Before it goes in, the DBOBject for query.getCriteriaObject()&amp;apos;s toString() shows:






{




"cardId" : "12345" , 




"interactionTime" : { "$lte" : { "$date" : "2012-01-18T00:44:06.469Z"}} , 




"isDeleted" : false , 




"actionCode" : { "$in" : [ "AVATAR_STAND"]} , 




"sourcePersonId" : { "$in" : [ "4f1615cb036416a89c12a60f"]}




}






after query mapper, when it gets passed into new FindCallback(...), the query DBObject is reduced to only the following:






{




"cardId" : "12345" , 




"interactionTime" : { "$lte" : { "$date" : "2012-01-18T00:44:06.469Z"}}




}






So I&amp;apos;m not sure exactly what I&amp;apos;m doing wrong / missing, but something between M5 and GA must&amp;apos;ve changed. Any pointers?
Here&amp;apos;s part of my class, in case it&amp;apos;s any help:






@Document




public class CardInteraction {




  @Id private String interactionId;




  private String cardId;




  private String sourcePersonId;




  private ActionCodeEnum actionCode; // a java enum class




  private Date interactionTime;




  private boolean isDeleted;









  ...




}
