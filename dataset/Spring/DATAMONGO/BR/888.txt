Mapping is not applied to SortObject during queries.
during find() method with query that has Sort clause. The mapping hasn&amp;apos;t been applied to Sort Object.
For e.g., I defined a filed as Id as followed.
@Id
private String orderId.  
Then I have query condition like this. query.with(new Sort("orderId"));
Then the actual query should be sorted on "_id" (after mapping). But the sort is sent as is with "orderId".
I have found this for find() method. May be the case in all places where the Sort Object is used.
