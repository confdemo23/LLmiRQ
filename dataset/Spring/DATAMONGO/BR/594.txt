cross-store=> Define document name using annotation
In a cross-store configuration, the RelatedDocument is stored in a MongoDB collection using the container&amp;apos;s Entity&amp;apos;s package name.
It would be nice if the collection name would be either the name of the class (document, not entity) or as specified using annotations(@Document(collection="")).
This "issue" is caused by the class
org.springframework.data.mongodb.crossstore.MongoChangeSetPersister
which gets the name of the collection from the method getCollectionNameForEntity which does:
return ClassUtils.getQualifiedName(entityClass);
