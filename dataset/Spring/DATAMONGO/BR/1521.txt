Aggregation.skip(...) expects int but new SkipOperation(...) supports long
Currently the class SkipOperation takes an long as only parameter, the static factory method Aggregation.skip() takes an int. As the skip-operation seems to support long, should the static factory-method also use long?






public static SkipOperation skip(int elementsToSkip) {




		return new SkipOperation(elementsToSkip);




}









public SkipOperation(long skipCount) {




		Assert.isTrue(skipCount &gt;= 0, "Skip count must not be negative!");




		this.skipCount = skipCount;




}
