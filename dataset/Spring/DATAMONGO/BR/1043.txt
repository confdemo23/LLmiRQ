SpEL Expressions in @Document annotations are not re-evaluated for query executions
Based on the idea of Oliver Gierke in https://jira.spring.io/browse/DATAMONGO-525 I followed some post like the ones below
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18129291/mongodb-and-spel-expressions-in-document-annotations
and
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19807733/mongodb-multi-tenacy-spel-with-document?rq=1
but in the end I realized that the problem is that AbstractMongoQuery is cached between requests(maybe a problem in my config?), and its query-method object of type MongoQueryMethod, which holds the metadata, MongoEntityMetadata. And thus make this approach (use SpEL in @Document annotation) not fully working.
AbstractMongoQuery deals with different kind of executions. All of them but SingleEntityExecution suffers from this problem, and it&amp;apos;s because in SingleEntityExecution mongoOperations is called without passing collectionName and thus letting, in the end, BasicMongoPersistentEntity.getCollection apply SpEL over entity class to obtain the runtime collection name.
