Exception during authentication in multithreaded access
Bug &amp; further details are here:

Specifically what can be used for a test case is use a ThreadPoolExecutor, set a minpool and maxpool value of 5, add 25 objects to be executed.  Those objects are a class which implements Runnable.  
Those objects each then perform a bunch of inserts into mongoDB using a DocumentDao which calls mongoOperations.insert.
thanks
