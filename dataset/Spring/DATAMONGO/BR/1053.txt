In 1.6, any field in a mapped object named "language" will fail to map if it is a type other than String
In 1.6, there is now a restriction that a field named "language" must be a String.  So, in 1.5, the following will map but will not map in 1.6:






package com.instantly.pipeline.engine.model;









import javax.persistence.Id;









public class Foobar {









    @Id




    String id;




    




    private Number language;









    public String getId() {




        return id;




    }









    public void setId(String id) {




        this.id = id;




    }









    public Number getLanguage() {




        return language;




    }









    public void setLanguage(Number language) {




        this.language = language;




    }




}
