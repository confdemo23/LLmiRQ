Declaring a list of DBRef in a domian class results in Null for each DBRef when reading from mongo database
We have a requirement that we have to be able to define the following field in our domain class. The reason that we need to have such restriction is that this domain is used for integration with another system.






@Field("deletions")




private List&lt;com.mongodb.DBRef&gt; deletions;






Saving of deletions collections works fine and I can verify deletions list stored properly. However, when the list is read from Mongo DB, all instance of com.mongodb.DBRef are null. I had the same issue with having define one com.mongodb.DBRef in a domain class, but I could get around with that by creating a reading converter that converts from com.mongodb.DBRef to com.mongodb.DBRef
