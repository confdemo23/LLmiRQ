Retrieve of existing Mongo DB from Transaction is not working
dbHolder.doesNotHoldNonDefaultDB() in MongoDbUtils.doGetDB() is always false, so the DbHolder is never used. 
MongoDbUtils.doGetDB() is also always registering synchronization for the same Mongo instance on every call. For two or more calls it fails to unbindResource() because resource is already unbounded.
