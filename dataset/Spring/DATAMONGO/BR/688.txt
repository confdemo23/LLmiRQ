There is no precedence between @Id annotation and field named "id" - both are attempted to be used
If you have a domain class with an attribute named "id", even if you annotate a DIFFERENT field with "@Id", spring-data-mongo errors trying to map 2 things to the id.  While the error is correct in that you can&amp;apos;t have 2, it surprises me that one doesn&amp;apos;t take precedence over the other.
I tried (in vain) to find this issue listed in jira, having read about it from a post in the forums after hitting the same issue myself, so apologies if this is a duplicate.
