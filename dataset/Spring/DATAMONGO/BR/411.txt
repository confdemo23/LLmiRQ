Potential ClassCastExceptions in MongoPersistentEntityIndexCreator
The Spring ApplicationEvent mechanism uses some mechanism to select event listeners based on generic types. Unfortunately it does not consider nested generic types which we use to distinguish a mapping event for MongoDB from one for Neo4j e.g. Thus the MongoPersistentEntityIndexCreator will get invoked for mapping events for other stores as well. Thus we have to double check the event types before invoking further code.
