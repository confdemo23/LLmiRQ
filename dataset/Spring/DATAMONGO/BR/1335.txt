DBObjectAccessor doesn&apos;t write properties correctly if multiple ones are nested
When DBObjectAccessor is building the BasicDBObject it could check if the current dbObject already holds a BasicDBObject for the given key
And thus documents like the one below will be inserted correctly (now only "id" and "desc"  are inserted)






    public class One {




      @Id String id;




      @Field("DATA.TITLE") String title;




      @Field("DATA.DESC") String desc;




     ....




    }






I have provided a sample projecte with a few tests in order to verify the behaviour before and after the proposed change.
I am aware that field names cannot contain the dot (.) character (https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/document/#field-names), and that data structures like the one before should be mapped with a Map BUT now the read process can cope with this kind of data structures so I am wondering if we can improve the write process to cover this case.  JUST AN IDEA
