Unique Index on DBRef
I&amp;apos;m not able to uniquely index a property if it&amp;apos;s a reference.
For example: 











@DBRef




@Indexed(unique = true) // This does not work because of @DBRef




private User user1;









@Indexed(unique = true) // This works fine




private User user1;











I know that it&amp;apos;s possible to unique index a DBRef, so I&amp;apos;m not sure why this doesn&amp;apos;t work. It seems like a pretty important piece of functionality.
