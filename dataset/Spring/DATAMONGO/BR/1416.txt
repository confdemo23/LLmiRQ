Standard bootstrap issues warning in converter registration
I just upgraded to 1.9.1 from 1.8.4 and keep getting these warnings. 






org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.convert.CustomConversions:229 - Registering converter from class java.lang.Number to class java.lang.Number as writing converter although it doesn&amp;apos;t convert to a Mongo supported type! You might wanna check you annotation setup at the converter implementation






 I have NO custom converters configured.  Not sure where this is coming from or how to fix.
