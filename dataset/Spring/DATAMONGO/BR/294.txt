List elements nested in Map lose their type when persisted
Possibly related to DATAMONGO-273, objects in a List inside of a Map lose their type and can not be deserialized properly. When I run the attached test, I see this output:






{ "_class" : "net.emota.openspacedsr.MongoMapTest$Shipment" , 




  "boxes" : { 




     "one" : [ { "maker" : "Boeing" , "numberOfPropellers" : 4} , 




               { "railLine" : "Santa Fe" , "numberOfCars" : 200} , 




               { "make" : "Tesla" , "model" : "Roadster" , "numberOfDoors" : 2}]




}}






Where I would expect to see a _class attribute for each list element, allowing the proper reader conversions and letting the assertions in the test case pass.
