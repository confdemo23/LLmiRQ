findAndModify doesn&apos;t use field value annotation for update object
I am using the @Field annotation on some of my fields to keep the full variable name in java but shorten the mongodb key associated to it. Example: 






@Field(value = "desc")




protected String description;






Everywhere I can still use the java name (e.g. description) to query with criteria except in findAndModify() from the MongoTemplate class.
I dug into your code to try to understand why and noticed in doFindAndModify() you are not calling the mapper.getMappedObject() on the update object passed in parameters. Is there any reason for that? Because it is called in the doUpdate() (line 927).
It is not a big issue but just wanted to know why it was not consistent with the rest.
