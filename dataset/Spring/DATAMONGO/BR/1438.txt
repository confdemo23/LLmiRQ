I get a warning in my logs since switched to Spring Data MongoDB Hopper-SR1 Release Train in Spring Boot 1.3.5
When I start my Spring Boot 1.3.5 application with no custom conversions and with Spring Data MongoDB Release Train Hopper-SR1 I get following warning in my logs:






Registering converter from class java.lang.Number to class java.lang.Number as writing converter although it doesn&amp;apos;t convert to a Mongo supported type! You might wanna check you annotation setup at the converter implementation.






With the in Spring Boot 1.3.5 integrated version the warning is not exists..
I have alle my Domain classes they are saved in MongoDB annotated with @Document (see DATAMONGO-1413)
