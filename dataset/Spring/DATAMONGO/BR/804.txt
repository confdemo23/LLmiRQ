EnableMongoRepositories repositoryImplementationPostfix() default is empty String instead of "Impl"
In contrast to the doc, which states that the default repositoryImplementationPostfix is "Impl", the default is actually set to empty string:
String repositoryImplementationPostfix() default "";
Took me a while to figure out why my RepositoryImpl was not recognised...
