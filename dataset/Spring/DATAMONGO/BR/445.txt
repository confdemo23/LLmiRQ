GeoNear Query Doesn&apos;t Work with Pageable
I am trying to perform a geoNear query in conjunction with a point and a pageable parameter and it seems that the paging functionality doesn&amp;apos;t work. Regardless of what I set the page and size parameters of the pageable to the query always returns 100 results. I have created a test case that demonstrates the issue. Please note that there are three test cases with comments. The findAll() test case demonstrates paging functionality working as expected and the other two test cases demonstrate paging functionality not working. 
One possible clue as to what is going might be the fact that findAll() utilizes QueryUtils.applyPagination() in the SimpleMongoRepository class to specify the query skip and limit values but the same isn&amp;apos;t done for the geoNear queries and so it defaults to page 0 and size 100.
