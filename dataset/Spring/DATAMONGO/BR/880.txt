Error when trying to persist an object containing a DBRef which was lazy loaded.
When fetching a property which is annotated as DBRef(lazy = true) the object returned is a CGLIB proxy. If we use this proxy as a value for the property of a new object and try to persist it, the object is not found.






Template.java






// New object we are trying to persist




public class Template {









    private String id;




    @DBRef(lazy = true)




    private Content content;









}











If the template object above is loaded from the database and the content property is used for the message below, then the id of the DbRef is not resolved when saved since the target is a proxy.






Message.java






// New object we are trying to persist




public class Message {









    private String id;




    @DBRef




    private Content content;









}






A workaround would be to switch this object back to eager loading.
