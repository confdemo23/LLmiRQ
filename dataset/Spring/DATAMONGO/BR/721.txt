Polymorphic attribute type not persisted on update operations
We found a problem with Spring Data for Mongo DB.
Here is our situation: we have an entity which have an attribute which is a list of another kind of entity, like the code below.
@Document
public class ParentClass {
   private List&lt;ChildClass&gt; list;
}
the ChildClass is annotated with @Document too, but we want to store it&amp;apos;s content as an embed document of ParentClass.
When using MongoTemplate class with code such as below, the _class attribute is not inserted on the embedded document, so, if one of the items of the list attribute is a subclass of ChildClass, and ChildClass is an abstract class, we begin to face instantiation problems.
Here is one example of usage of MongoTemplate in which we found a problem.
mongoTemplate.updateFirst(Query.query(criteria), 
  new Update().push("list", child));
If child is a subclass of ChildClass, the _class attribute is not added to the embedded document.
