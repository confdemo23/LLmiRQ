org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.query.Field needs an equals method
The above class Field does not has an equals() method.
But org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.query.Query has an equals method which is using the equals method of the Field class.






boolean fieldsEqual = this.fieldSpec == null ? that.fieldSpec == null : this.fieldSpec.equals(that.fieldSpec);






Please implement an equals on the Field method.
Purpose: For unit testing the equals method is needed.
