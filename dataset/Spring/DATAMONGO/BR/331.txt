Wrong enumeration value in schema
In the XML schema for spring mongo  http://www.springframework.org/schema/data/mongo/spring-mongo-1.0.xsd in the restricted values for write-concern attribute there is REPLICA_SAFE while in the java  type (com.mongodb.WriteConcern) the name is REPLICAS_SAFE , please either change the schema or the class to the appropriate form.
