Authentication mechanism PLAIN  changes to SCRAM-SHA-1 
We have a mongodb properly configured with plain authentication mechanism, and we can successfully log in using mongodb client. However, if we try to connect using mongo driver + spring data, login is incorrect due to authentication mechanism sent is SCRAM-SHA-1 and not PLAIN.
We have made a code review and a full debug and the problem seems to be in MongoDbUtils.doGetDB(Mongo, String, UserCredentials, boolean, String) method, in the synchronized block, since the authentication mechanism seems to get lost there.
Our spring data configuration is:






&lt;mongo:db-factory uri="mongodb://user:pass@ip1:port1,ip2:port2,/logCenter?authSource=$external&amp;amp;authMechanism=PLAIN" /&gt;









&lt;bean id="mongoTemplate" class="org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.MongoTemplate"&gt;




	&lt;constructor-arg name="mongoDbFactory" ref="mongoDbFactory"&gt;&lt;/constructor-arg&gt;




&lt;/bean&gt;




	




&lt;mongo:repositories base-package="com.xxx.repositories" /&gt;
