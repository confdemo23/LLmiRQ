Query creation from method names using AND criteria does not work anymore
When migrating from 1.0.1 to 1.0.2, one of my test failed.






@Test




public void testFindByPseudoAndPassword_wrongPseudo() {




    Member member = new Member("pseudo");




    member.setPassword("password");









    memberRepository.save(member);









    Member findMember = memberRepository.findByPseudoAndPassword("wrong-pseudo", "password");




    assertThat(findMember).isNull(); // FAILS HERE because the query retrieve the member with password equals "password" and miss the pseudo value




}






and the log is : 





 DEBUG [MongoTemplate] findOne using query: { "password" : "password" , "$and" : [ { "password" : "password"}]} 






I saw that in https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-data-mongodb/blob/1.0.x/spring-data-mongodb/src/test/java/org/springframework/data/mongodb/repository/query/MongoQueryCreatorUnitTests.java there is no assertion for the test #createsQueryCorrectly which test the Criteria AND case.
May be it is due to https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-data-mongodb/commit/c8bb46ffb3b2ffa5456417a199ffa0d3b977bf0b
