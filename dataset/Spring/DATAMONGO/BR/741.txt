Trying to &apos;group&apos; on a field of a sub-object causes an error in Spring Data MongoDB 1.3.0.RC1
Using the new Aggregation support fails when I try to &amp;apos;group&amp;apos; on a property of a sub-object.  The referenced Gist should give enough context.  Following things in the debugger lead me to believe that the code is trying to resolve the &amp;apos;code&amp;apos; property on the parent object instead of the contained sub-object.  Using a top-level property works great.  I&amp;apos;ve run the equivalent aggregation in the MongoDB shell and it allows me to &amp;apos;group&amp;apos; on the sub-object&amp;apos;s property so it doesn&amp;apos;t appear to be illegal in MongoDB.
