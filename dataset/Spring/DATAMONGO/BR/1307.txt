Stop converting user-defined runtime exceptions to NPEs
MongoTemplate has code like this in many places:
} catch (RuntimeException ex) {
	throw exceptionTranslator.translateExceptionIfPossible(ex);
MongoExceptionTranslator, however, often does NOT return an exception. If it encounters an unknown exception it does this:
// If we get here, we have an exception that resulted from user code,
// rather than the persistence provider, so we return null to indicate
// that translation should not occur.
return null;
MongoTemplate then "eats" the original exception and throws a null-pointer exception instead.
MongoTemplate should throw the original exception if it gets null back from the exception translator.
