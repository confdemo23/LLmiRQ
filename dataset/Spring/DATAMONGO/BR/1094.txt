Wrong reference to @DocumentField in error message
Looking through the code, it looks like this message is outdated:
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-mongodb/blob/master/spring-data-mongodb/src/main/java/org/springframework/data/mongodb/core/mapping/BasicMongoPersistentEntity.java#L56
I guess it should just refer to the @Field annotation to disambiguate? According to git blame this has been there for quite a while
