Wrong query created when one value is a DBObject
Regression in 1.0.0-RELEASE. Works as expected in 1.0.0-RC1
Query: { "type" : 
{ "$in" : [ "folder"]}
 , "deleted" : false }
When a query contains a DBObject as a value like "type" in the example QueryMapper.getMappedObject will return in line 103 ignoring all further keys of the query.
This results in the query { "type" : 
{ "$in" : [ "folder"]}
 } sent to MongoDB.
