geoNear, does not return all matching elements, it returns only a max of 100 documents
Aloha,
I have the following query:






public GeoResults&lt;MyObject&gt; findByTypeAndLocationNear(MyObjectType type, Point p, Distance distance) {




   final NearQuery nearQuery = NearQuery.near(p).maxDistance(distance);




   log.info("{}",nearQuery.toDBObject());




   return mongoTemplate.geoNear(nearQuery, MyObject.class);




}






The geoNear method is documented like this:






Returns {@link GeoResults} for all entities matching the given {@link NearQuery}.






I expect 1000 "matching" documents But i only get 100. There is some default being set, that restricts the result to 100. That should be stated in the method. And another method having a pageable should be added.
What do you think?
