Different results when using count and find with the same criteria with &apos;id&apos; field
Assume we have following query:






Query q = query(where(&amp;apos;id&amp;apos;).regex(&amp;apos;zzz&amp;apos;))






mongoTemplate.find(q,java.util.HashMap.class,&amp;apos;test&amp;apos;) gives following query (peeked in mongo console):






{ "ts" : ISODate("2013-03-22T10:00:51.685Z"),




  "op" : "query",




  "ns" : "test.test",




  "query" : {




		"id" : /zzz/




	},




	"nscanned" : 1,




	"responseLength" : 20,




	"millis" : 0,




	"client" : "127.0.0.1",




	"user" : ""




}






The same query, when used in count (mongoTemplate.count(q,&amp;apos;test&amp;apos;)) gives:






{




	"ts" : ISODate("2013-03-22T10:00:36.299Z"),




	"op" : "command",




	"ns" : "test.$cmd",




	"command" : {




		"count" : "test",




		"query" : {




			"_id" : /zzz/




		}




	},




	"ntoreturn" : 1,




	"responseLength" : 48,




	"millis" : 0,




	"client" : "127.0.0.1",




	"user" : ""




}






This is inconsistent since we could have records with field id and they will be retrieved properly from the db. Count on the other hand will give bad results since it uses _id field.
In org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.convert.QueryMapper the method determineKey, for some reason treats id and _id as the same field. This is probably the cause of the strange behaviour because find() method does not use QueryMapper and count() does.
