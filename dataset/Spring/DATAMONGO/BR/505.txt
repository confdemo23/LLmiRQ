Conversion of associations doesn&apos;t work for collection values
Assume you have the following scenario:






class Entity {









  Long id;




  @DBRef




  Property property;




}









class Property {




  Long id;




}









interface EntityRepository extends Repository&lt;Entity, Long&gt; {









  Entity findByPropertyIn(Property... property);




}






The execution of findByProperty() will fail as the given array (or collection) is not correctly translated into a collection of DBRefs. The reason is that ConvertingIterator treats the value as is and wants to create a DBRef from it. We need to unwrap the elements and convert them into DBRef instances one by one.
