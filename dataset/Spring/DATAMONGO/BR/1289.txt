NullPointerException when saving an object with no "id" field or @Id annotation
According to the documentation:

If no field or property specified above is present in the Java class then an implicit &amp;apos;_id&amp;apos; file will be generated by the driver but not mapped to a property or field of the Java class.

Instead of this, I&amp;apos;m seeing a NullPointerException when attempting to save an object that doesn&amp;apos;t have an "id" field or an @Id annotated field.
This was working in 1.6.0, but seems to have changed at least in 1.6.2 (did not test 1.6.1) and is still not working as I expect in newer versions
