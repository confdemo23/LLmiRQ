QueryMapper is getting a ClassCasteException When trying to Convert an ArrayList to a BSONList
I am using Mongodb java driver (mongo-java-driver - 2.7.2) to create a Query using QueryBuilder and then using QueryBuilder to get the DBObject to create a BasicQuery; then using MongoTemplate&amp;apos;s find method by passing the BasicQuery Object.  Getting a ClassCastException in QueryMapper - trying cast an ArrayList to a BasicBSONList.  Using version 1.0.0.M4.  It would be nice if a patch is applied to this version??  Attached is the changes I made in order to make it work.
