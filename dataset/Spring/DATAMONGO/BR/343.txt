ServerAddressPropertyEditor disables default Spring conversion
After upgrading to 1.0 RC1, we are getting the following error on an unrelated bean






java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cannot convert value of type [java.util.HashMap$Values] to required type [java.util.List]: PropertyEditor [org.springframework.data.mongodb.config.ServerAddressPropertyEditor] returned inappropriate value






The exception is thrown on a bean that has @Autowired List constructor argument where the values of the List are collected from the Spring context. (Basically, we want to inject all beans of given type). This bean has nothing to do with Mongo but when the ServerAddressPropertyEditor is defined, it&amp;apos;s used for all conversions to java.util.List. It is not correct.
