CannotGetMongoDbConnectionException should not print password in logfile
When the provided password and / or user is wrong we receive the following exception:






Error creating bean with name &amp;apos;sameCoolClassRepository&amp;apos;: FactoryBean threw exception on object creation; nested exception is org.springframework.data.mongodb.CannotGetMongoDbConnectionException:




Failed to authenticate to database [mydbname], username = [myusername], password = [thecleartextpassword]






Spring Data should never print the password in the logiles.
Suggested solution: print first and last letter: &amp;apos;mysecret&amp;apos; gets &amp;apos;m**************t&amp;apos;
