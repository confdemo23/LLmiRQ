Fix failing test in ServerAddressPropertyEditorUnitTests.
The test rejectsAddressConfigWithoutASingleParsableServerAddress fails because the supposedly non-existing hostname "bar" "now" resolves to a real host-address: 
```
tom@gauss ~/Documents/dev/repos/spring/spring-data-mongodb (master)$ ping bar
PING bar (127.0.53.53): 56 data bytes
Request timeout for icmp_seq 0
```
