IgnoreCase should escape queries
The IgnoreCase query generator is subject to a sort of "regex injection" attack, because the query generator simply slaps ^..$ around the string and passes it directly to MongoDB. This fails when the string contains any sort of special characters. In my case, I&amp;apos;m trying to perform a case-insensitive find on an e-mail address with the + sign, a legal character, but the regex interprets this as 1..*.
The query generator needs to properly escape regex-special characters.
