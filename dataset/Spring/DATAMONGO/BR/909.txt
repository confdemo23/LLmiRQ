@CompoundIndex on inherited entity classes
Whenever an entity class is annotated with @CompoundIndexes, it does create the relevant index in the collection. Yet any other entity class that inherits from the first entity class does not inherit this index and thus the @CompoundIndexes annotation has to be repeated in the child classes even though it references the parent class. Its counter-intuitive and one would expect the annotation to apply to child classes also.
