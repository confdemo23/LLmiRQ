ReadPreference not used for Aggregations.
From the referenced issue on SO:

It turned out that spring-data-mongodb does not pass the read preference specified on mongoTemplate to the underlying com.mongodb.Mongo connection pool - for aggregations. It would pass the read preference for simple find operations.
