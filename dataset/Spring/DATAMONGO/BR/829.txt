NearQuery, when used in conjunction with a Query, it sets num=0, unless Query specifies otherwise
Hello,
i have built the following query:






public GeoResults&lt;MyObject&gt; findByTypeAndLocationNear(MyObjectType type, Point p, Distance distance) {




   final Query query = Query.query(Criteria.where("type").is(type.name()));




   final NearQuery nearQuery = NearQuery.near(p).maxDistance(distance).query(query);




   log.info("{}",nearQuery.toDBObject());




   return mongoTemplate.geoNear(nearQuery, MyObject.class);




}






And it logs to this:






{ "query" : { "type" : "small"} , "maxDistance" : 1.567855942887398E-4 , "distanceMultiplier" : 6378.137 , "num" : 0 , "near" : [ x , y] , "spherical" : true}






Where is this "num=0" coming from? I did not set any limits.
In the 1.2.1 release, "num" is an Integer and is only used in the DBObject, when it is != null. When i set a Query, "num" is left untouched and therefore it does not appear in the DBObject. See [1]
Starting from 1.2.4 release, "num" is still an Integer, but when i set a Query, this time "num" gets the "limit" value of the Query, which by default is always 0. See [2]
I dont see this subtle change mentioned in the latest change file.
My opinion is, to use the limit value from Query is very convenient and makes sense, but it should only be used, if someone has explicitly set a limit for the Query object (probably its enough to check, if the limit is &gt; 0)
The same applies on "skip", but it is not used in NearQuery anyways.
What do you guys think?
