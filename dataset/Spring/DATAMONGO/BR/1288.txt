Update.inc(String, Number) method fails to work with AtomicInteger
Even though the org.springframework.data.mongodb.core.query.Update.inc(String, Number) method takes the parameter as Number, it doesn&amp;apos;t actually work right with things that aren&amp;apos;t simple primitive object wrappers.  For example, if you pass in an AtomicInteger, the update fails to execute, as the generated json isn&amp;apos;t correct.
