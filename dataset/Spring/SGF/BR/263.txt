The &apos;disk-synchronous&apos; Region attribute does not get successfully applied when explicitly set to false.
Currently, when a user sets the disk-synchronous attribute when defining a GemFire Region using Spring Data GemFire XML namespace meta-data, the value is ignored if explicitly set to false.  GemFire defaults the value of diskSynchronous RegionAttributes property to true, which effectively has no affect.
Furthermore, the disk-synchronous attribute on the baseReadOnlyRegionType in the SDG XML schema currently defaults the value to false.  However, this will have not effect since the attribute is not properly parsed, thus resulting in Regions always being defined with synchronous disk access when using the SDG XML namespace.
