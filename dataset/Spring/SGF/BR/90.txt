Documentation Error - Configuring a GemFire CacheServer
http://static.springsource.org/spring-gemfire/docs/current/reference/bootstrap.html
"To avoid initialization problems, the CacheServers started by SGF will start after the container has been fully initialized. This allows potential regions, listener, writers or instantiators defined declaratively to be fully initialized and registered before the server starts accepting connections. Keep this in mind when doing programmatic configuration of the items above as the server might start before your components and thus not be seen by the clients connecting right away."
Shouldn&amp;apos;t the marked area above (before) be "after"?
