Respect manual-start on Gateway Senders/Receivers but no longer couple the start/stop lifecycle to the Spring container.
Currently, the start() and stop() lifecycle methods of the GemFire/Geode GatewaySender and GatewayReceiver objects are coupled to the Spring container lifecycle by way of the Spring SmartLifecycle interface.  Both the SDG GatewaySenderFactoryBean and GatewayReceiverFactoryBean implement the Spring SmartLifecycle interface. 
This task will remove the SmartLifecycle interface implementation from the SDG GatewaySenderFactoryBean and the GatewaySenderFactoryBean and solely rely on the GemFire/Geode GatewaySenderFactory.setManualStart(:boolean) and GatewayReceiverFactory.setManualStart(:boolean)|http://data-docs-samples.cfapps.io/docs-gemfire/latest/javadocs/japi/com/gemstone/gemfire/cache/wan/GatewayReceiverFactory.html#setManualStart(boolean)] methods and behavior.
