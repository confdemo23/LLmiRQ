Allow early initialization and re-initialization of LazyWiringDeclarableSupport instances.
A problem occurs when a GemFire Function extends the LazyWiringDeclarableSupport class and is redeployed using the Gfsh deploy command to the update the GemFire-defined Function.
This results in the Declarable init(parameters:Properties) method being called twice which is guarded by the LazyWiringDeclarableSupport class.
It would also be nice to completely replace the WiringDeclarableSupport with the more recent and capable LazyWiringDeclarableSupport class.
