The GatewayReceiverFactoryBean needs to set GatewayReceiverFactory.setManualStart(false) in GemFire 8.1 in order to enable manual starts on a GatewayReceiver.
Due to changes in GemFire 8.1, even though Spring Data GemFire&amp;apos;s &lt;gfe:gateway-receiver/&gt; XML namespace (XSD) element for configuring and creating GemFire GatewayReceiver components as a bean in the Spring container supports "manual starts" using the manual-start attribute, the SDG GatewayReceiverFactoryBean now needs to properly set GemFire&amp;apos;s GatewayReceiverFactory.setManualStart(:boolean), otherwise the GatewayReceiver will start on initialization even when manual-start is explicitly set to true as determined by GatewayReceiver.isRunning().
