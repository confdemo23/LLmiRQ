It should be valid to configure a disk store with a non-persistent region for overflow
Currently it appears that (from RegionFactoryBean.java) "it is invalid to specify a disk store if &amp;apos;persistent&amp;apos; is set to false." In GemFire, this is not always the case, partition_overflow and replicate_overflow regions, though not persistent, can use a user configured disk store. This effect of this limitation in Spring GemFire is that non-persistent regions with overflow are forced to use the default disk store.
