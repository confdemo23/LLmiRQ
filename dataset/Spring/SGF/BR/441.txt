Fix possible CacheClosedException in ClientCacheFactoryBean onApplicationEvent(:ContextRefreshedEvent) when the ClientCache initialization is lazy.
The ClientCacheFactoryBean.isReadyForEvents() method may throw a GemFire CacheClosedException during onApplicationEvent(:ContextRefereshedEvent) since the ClientCache initialization maybe lazy, in which case, the ClientCache will not have been properly "initialized" before being "looked up" in the ClientCacheFactory.getAnyInstance() call inside ClientCacheFactoryBean.fetchCache(), thus leading to the CacheClosedException.
