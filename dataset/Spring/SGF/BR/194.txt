Nested region do not work
Both client and server configurations for sub regions do not work. Although the server configuration will run it does not create the actual sub regions in the cluster as can be seen from the gemfire logs, gfsh and pulse.
The client xsd configuration does not allow for sub regions either.
All of this functionality is critical to a client delivery as we are using SI and SGF extensively.
