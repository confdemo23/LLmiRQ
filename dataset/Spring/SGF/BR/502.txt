DiskStoreAndEvictionRegionParsingTest fails when building with Maven due to missing Disk Store sub-directory.
The DiskStoreAndEvictionRegionParsingTest class fails when SDG is built with Maven since the test class assumes the project is being built with Gradle and the Disk Store sub-directory is relative to the Gradle build directory ($PWD/build).
