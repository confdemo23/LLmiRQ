GemfirePersistentProperty considers a BigDecimal property an entity.
A call to GemfirePersistentProperty.isEntity() returns true for a property of type BigDecimal which it probably shouldn&amp;apos;t. By default the implementation is checking the type against a well known list of (store) simple types (i.e. types the store can natively persist, see SimpleTypeHolder) which probably needs to be extended to include BigDecimal as I assume Gemfire to be able to store BigDecimal instances directly.
