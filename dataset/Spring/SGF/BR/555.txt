Repository queries on client Regions associated with a Pool configured for a specific server group can lead to a RegionNotFoundException.
This bug can occur when using SDG Repositories to perform client/server queries across a cluster of data servers organized in separate server groups in order to balance the load of data access based on function (UC).
Each application Repository is coded to a specific application domain type, which in turn is associated with a specific GemFire (client) Region (via the @Region annotation).  The (client) Region is configured with a GemFire Pool targeting a specific server group.
However, when SDG obtains an instance of the QueryService from the Region (technically, the ClientCache) to perform the Repository query, GemFire does not automatically use the Pool associated with the Region unless it is specifically told to do so via the appropriate API call (which SDG fails does not do; hence this bug) and the client query results in a RegionNotFoundException.
