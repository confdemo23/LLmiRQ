Enable Local Region Eviction action to be set to &apos;LOCAL_DESTROY&apos;, which is allowed in GemFire using the public API or in cache.xml.
Currently, SDG "fixes" the Eviction action policy to "OVERFLOW_TO_DISK", on Local (client) Regions, however GemFire does support "LOCAL_DESTROY" for Local (client) Regions as well.
