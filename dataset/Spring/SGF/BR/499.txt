Prevent SDG-defined Pools from being destroyed before the Regions that use them
Currently, when a Spring configured, GemFire client cache application is shutdown, SDG does not prescribe an orderly shutdown between client Regions and client Pools possibly referred to by those Regions.  As a result, GemFire will throw an error when an attempt is made to close/destroy the Pool that a Region may currently be configured to use during shutdown of the Spring application context.






11:34:44.957 WARN o.s.b.f.s.DisposableBeanAdapter - Invocation of destroy method failed on bean with name &amp;apos;gemfirePool&amp;apos;: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Pool could not be destroyed because it is still in use by 16 regions 






While the error is reported as a warning and is mostly benign (since it only happens during shutdown), more careful coordination between the Regions and their Pools should be considered.
