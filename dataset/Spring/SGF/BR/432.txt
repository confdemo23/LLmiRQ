IndexFactoryBean traps IndexExistsException instead of IndexNameConflictException.
GemFire throws several Index related Exceptions on attempts to create Indexes. The one that is currently caught by spring-data-gemfire is IndexExistsException, which occurs when an Index of the same definition exists. GemFire also throws IndexNameConflictException, which occurs when an Index with the same name exists.
In at least GemFire 6.6.3 and 7.0.2.3, the IndexNameConflictException is the Exception thrown when two instances of an Index with the same name and definition are created simultaneously. In spring-data-gemfire 1.5.2.RELEASE and onwards, Exceptions are no longer swallowed during Index creation, so the IndexNameConflictException is thrown and not handled, while the IndexExistsException is handled, but may return null as the Index may not be named identically.
