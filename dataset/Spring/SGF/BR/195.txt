colocated-with fails on partition region
The colocated-with attribute on the &lt;partitioned-region&gt; element fails with the following exception:
Region specified in &amp;apos;colocated-with&amp;apos; is not present. It should be created before setting &amp;apos;colocated-with&amp;apos; to this region.
This is due to the order in which the regions are created.  The colocated-with attribute specifies a region name, but the order in which the regions are created is dependent on the injection order, which may be different than the order in which the regions appear in the context file.  This can happen when the regions are injected into a class using @Resource(name="")
The colocated-with attribute should specify the region bean name as a reference rather than the region name itself.  This would ensure that the order in which the region beans are created is consistent with the dependency order that Gemfire requires when creating colocated regions.
Test project is attached.
