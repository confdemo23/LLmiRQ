Exceptions thrown using WS-Addressing result in Assert failure in Addressing10.addAddressingHeaders
When using WS-Addressing if any interceptor or endpoint throws an Exception the implicit interceptor created by AbstractAddressingEndpointMapping will cause an Assertion failure because it has a null faultAction URI.  When this happens no response is sent to the client.
Exposing a faultActionURI to the user in AbstractAddressingEndpointMapping to be used to create the interceptor would fix the problem.  If the user is implementing something that uses WS-BaseFaults this would be required anyhow, and the default behavior could be to use the responseAction if the faultAction is not set.
