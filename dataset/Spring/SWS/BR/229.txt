JibxMarshaller should support marshalling/unmarshalling of all mapped classes
The current version of JiBX (1.1.5) supports marshalling and unmarshalling of all classes defined in binding definition file, for single IBindingFactory instance. The class that is passed in to BindingDirectory to get the factory instance is just used to locate the generated class that contains binding information - it is not the only class that this factory can marshall/unmarshall.
The solution: The supports() method of org.springframework.oxm.jibx.JibxMarshaller should be modified to return true for all mapped classes of IBindingFactory.
