AxiomSoapFaultDetailElementIterator does not consider whitespace nodes
The org.springframework.ws.soap.axiom.AxiomSoapFaultDetail$AxiomFaultDetailElementIterator throws a ClassCastException if the Fault Detail element contains whitespace nodes, e.g. line breaks (\n). This seems to be due to the fact that the next() method casts everything to OMElement and does not consider OMTextImpl nodes (which represent whitespace).
