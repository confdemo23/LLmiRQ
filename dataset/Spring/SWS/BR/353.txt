Schema inlining results in duplicate inlining of files referenced from multiple files
Suppose you have two files foo-response.xsd and bar-response.xsd referenceing a common domain.xsd the Dynamic WSDL creation will cause the domain.xsd to be inlined twice in the WSDL.
This causes trouble to JAX-WS wsimport utility as elements appera twice in the same namespace.
