Reloading the spring context does not refresh the MessageDispatcherServlet
Our application uses a special classloader from which it can load beans dynamically. The applicationcontext is reloaded to do this. The normal DispatcherServlet has a mechanism to allow the applicationcontext to be reloaded by overriding the onRefresh method. The MessageDispatcherServlet does not do this and crashes occur when webservices are invoked. 
The class below can be used as a workaround.






public class FixedMessageDispatcherServlet




	extends MessageDispatcherServlet




{









	private boolean initializing = true;









	@Override




	protected void onRefresh(ApplicationContext context)




	{




		try {




			if (this.initializing) {




				this.initializing = false;




			} else {




				this.initFrameworkServlet();




			}




		} catch (Exception e) {




			throw new RuntimeException(e);




		}




	}




}
