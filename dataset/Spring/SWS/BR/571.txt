Illegal SoapAction header: "
It seems that spring ws generates an illegal soapaction if no explicit soapaction is provided: an unmatched double quote. 
A quick look at the SoapUtils class shows the problem:






 public static String escapeAction(String soapAction) {




        if (soapAction == null) {




            soapAction = "";




        }




        if (!soapAction.startsWith("\"")) {




            soapAction = "\"" + soapAction;




        }




        if (!soapAction.endsWith("\"")) {




            soapAction = soapAction + "\"";




        }




        return soapAction;




    }






If you pass null as argument, it will return " instead of ""
