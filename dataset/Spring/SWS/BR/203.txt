Namespace declarations may be removed from the wsdl when transformWsdlLocations = true
See http://forum.springframework.org/showthread.php?t=44599
When a SimpleWsdl11Definition is used in combination with transformWsdlLocations=true, namespace declarations are removed which leads to an invalid wsdl. 
Resetting transfromWsdlLocations to false resolves the issue (with the penalty that the wsdl locations are no longer transformed).
