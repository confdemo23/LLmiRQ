No way to propagate exception from an AbstractSaxPayloadEndpoint
The invoke method on AbstractSaxPayloadEndpoint declares that it can throw an exception, but there is no way to propagate checked exceptions back to it from createContentHandler and getResponse.  I need to be able to throw an exception from getResponse so an appropriate SOAP fault can be created.  All other Endpoint implementations seem to support this in some way.
