AbstractMethodEndpointMapping does not support JDK Proxies
AbstractMethodEndpointMapping has a method, getEndpointClass, which attempts to determine the correct base class for an endpoint.  This method correctly deals with CGLIB-based proxies, but does not handle the more common JDK proxies.
One solution would be to use the AopUtils.getTargetClass method to perform this check.
