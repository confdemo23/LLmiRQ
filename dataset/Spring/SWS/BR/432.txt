AxiomSoap12Body.getFault() returns object of type AxiomSoap11Fault
AxiomSoap12Body.getFault() returns object of type AxiomSoap11Fault
Cause: AxiomSoap12Body does not implement the method getFault. So the getFault() method of the super class AxiomSoapBody is called which returns an object of type AxiomSoap11Fault.
Proposal to solve the issue: Remove the getFault() method from the super class and implement specific methods in the sub classes AxiomSoap11Body respectively AxiomSoap12Body.
