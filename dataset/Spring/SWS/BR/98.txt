Changing URL in CommonsHttpMessageSender
There is no way of modifying the URL in CommonsHttpMessageSender.  In its current form, it is well suited for a hard coded URL, but does not handle setting the URL at runtime.  If you try to set up CommonsHttpMessageSender in the applicationContext.xml file without providing a URL, it will fail on startup.  If you provide a default URL, and then try to override it using the setUrl method, the new URL will not be used.  I believe that HttpUrlConnectionMessageSender has the same issue.
