AcegiPlainTextPasswordValidationCallbackHandler doesn&apos;t implement InitializingBean
The AcegiPlainTextPasswordValidationCallbackHandler (both in xwss and wss4j packages) does provide an afterPropertiesSet method, but it is never called suring context setup, since it doesn&amp;apos;t implement the InitializingBean interface.
A workaround is to set it as "init-method" in the context.
