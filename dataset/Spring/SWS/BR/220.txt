Jaxb2Marshaller::supports method does not consider multiple marshallers
When evaluating multiple MarshallingMethodEndpointAdapters, each with their own Jaxb2MarshallingEndpoint, the first MarshallingMethodEndpointAdapter::supports method is always true.
We are building a modular application; where each endpoint is packaged as it&amp;apos;s own module.
Each of those endpoint modules has it&amp;apos;s own MarshallingMethodEndpointAdapter and it&amp;apos;s own Jaxb2Marshaller.
This means that when the webapp is packaged and running there will be multiple MarshallingMethodEndpointAdapters available to the MessageDispatcher.
The Jaxb2Marshaller::supports method is implemented to return true for any subclass of Jaxb2Element.






    public boolean supports(Class clazz) {




        if (JAXBElement.class.isAssignableFrom(clazz)) {




            return true;




        }




        ...




    }






The Jaxb2Marshaller should not even bother with this check, it should only return true if the JaxbContext is capable of supporting the given class.
