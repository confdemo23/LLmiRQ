NoSuchMethodError when using Axiom 1.2.14
The changes made for SWS-922 have resulted in Spring Web Services no longer working with Axiom 1.2.14. Specifically the move to using getSOAPMessage in place of the, deprecated in 1.2.15, getSoapMessage. IMO, it would be preferable to continue to use getSoapMessage and suppress the deprecation warning. This approach will make things compatible with Axiom 1.2.14 and 1.2.15.
