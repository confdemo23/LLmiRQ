Loading default key store overwrites truststore
When no keyStore property is set on the KeyStoreCallbackHandler a default key store is loaded. However, in stead of loading the keyStore it loads the trustStore with the data. See line 600 of KeyStoreCallbackHandler. This messes up the situation where you don&amp;apos;t need a keyStore, but do need a trustStore (like XML encryption).
