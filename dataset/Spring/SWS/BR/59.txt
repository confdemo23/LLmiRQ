CastorMarshaller does not marshal to DOM trees correctly
The CastorMarshaller does not create correct DOM trees. While marshalling to DOM nodes, castor uses a SAX2DOMHandler to publish SAX events into the DOM tree. This handler is a SAX 1 DocumentHandler, which has no native namespace support. There is a DocumentHandlerAdapter, which tries to correct this, but obviously that is failing.
