SpringWS client does not send Mtom attachments - it inlines them instead.
The actual problem that I have is that I cannot send large attachments with SpringWS-client.
I suspect the cause is that MTOM encoding in Spring does not work, even though mtomEnabled in org.springframework.oxm.jaxb.Jaxb2Marshaller is set to true. Without MTOM encoding the whole attachment is inlined, in memory, and then OutOfMemoryErrors can quickly occur.
With a Tcp monitor you can see that MTOM does in not work, while it does work with Axis. I demonstrate this in an Eclipse project, that I will try to attach to this issue.
Because of this, we are now forced to use Axis in our otherwise Spring-dominated project. This is quite unsatisfying.
