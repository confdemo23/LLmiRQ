Fix namespace prefix handling with StreamingPayload
The getName() method in JaxbStreamingPayload doesn&amp;apos;t report the actual
namespace prefix that is later generated by the writeTo method. With
Axiom 1.2.13 that didn&amp;apos;t cause problems, but 1.2.14 is less lenient,
causing an error as described in AXIOM-463.
This change:

Updates the StreamingPayload documentation to specify that the
namespace prefix in the QName returned by getName() has no significance
(which is effectively how things are currently).
Updates AxiomSoapBody so that it Axiom is aware that the namespace
prefix of the created OMSourcedElement is unknown.
Modifies the unit test for setStreamingPayload so that it uses a
StreamingPayload with a prefix mismatch.
