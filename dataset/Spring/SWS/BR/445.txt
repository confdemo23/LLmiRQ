CLONE -JibxMarshaller - marshalSaxHandlers
JiBX does not support SAX natively, so there is written to a buffer first:
ByteArrayOutputStream os = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
marshalOutputStream(graph, os);
ByteArrayInputStream is = new ByteArrayInputStream(os.toByteArray());
the character &lt; results in &amp;&lt;; and not in &lt; as expected.
