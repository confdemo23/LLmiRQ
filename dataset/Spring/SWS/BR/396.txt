@Endpoint with method having any other annotation then @PayloadRoot is not mapped
I&amp;apos;ve got @PayloadRoot annotated methods of @Endpoint and some methods also has @RolesAllowed from spring security. Today after upgrading from spring-ws 1.5.2 PayloadRootAnnotationMethodEndpointMapping stopped to processed this endpoint. I&amp;apos;ve also tried another (my custom @Log AOP annotation) annotation with same (bad) result. 
So now after last test, when any @Endpoint method has any other annotation then @PayloadRoot, it is not mapped.
