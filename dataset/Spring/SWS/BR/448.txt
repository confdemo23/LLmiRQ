Wss4jSecurityInterceptor accept messages when <wsse:header> is empty
http://forum.springframework.org/showthread.php?t=63553
The problem is when Wss4jSecurityInterceptor is used in the server side, to validate username token (or signature).
Everything looks fine except when a &lt;wsse:header&gt; empty is sent. The Interceptor lets the messsage goes and don&amp;apos;t
throw any exceptions.
As an attachment, I&amp;apos;m sending a maven project with JUnit tests to prove the case. The project is a very simple web service
based on the tutorial sample. I just configure the wss4j interceptor for validate username token.
The only test thats doesn&amp;apos;t pass is the last &amp;apos;testSendMessageWithEmptyWsseHeader&amp;apos;
Sorry for my english... it isn&amp;apos;t my native language.
