Infinite loop in XsdBasedSoap11Wsdl4jDefinitionBuilder#buildMessages method
When creating a WSDL based on XSD, the method XsdBasedSoap11Wsdl4jDefinitionBuilder#buildMessages goes in infinite loop trying to generate a new prefix for each namespace found in the XSD. It uses a very ugly while(true)/break implementation, forgetting to increment the counter i, so if you have more than one namespace it never reaches the break statement and loop indefinitely.
Very nasty bug with obvious fix.
