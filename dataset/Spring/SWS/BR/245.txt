SAXParseException when using HttpURLConnection
When using the HttpUrlConnection in combination with the WebServiceTemplate, the following exception occurs:
org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: The root element is required in a well-formed document
This seems to occur in Java 1.4, using SAAJ 1.2. A detailed description of the issue is available at http://forum.springframework.org/showthread.php?t=40413&amp;page=2
