WebServiceMessageReceiverHandlerAdapter not easily overridable to produce SOAP faults
WebServiceMessageReceiverHandlerAdapter has been changed recently to catch InvalidXmlException and return a HTTP 400 status code. We would like to instead return a SOAP fault with a detailed message of the parse error (I&amp;apos;m not certain but returning 400 is probably against the SOAP spec). This is impossible with the new implementation of WebServiceMessageReceiverHandlerAdapter without re-implementing the handle(...) method. 
Could the handling of this exception (and probably the non-POST transport method) be done by a separate protected method such that it can be overridden?
