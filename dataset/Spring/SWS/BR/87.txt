AbstractSoapMessage.getPayloadSource returns null with Axis SAAJ
Hi,
I have some more woes with Axis SAAJ.  This problem doesn&amp;apos;t occur with jdk1.5 and Sun&amp;apos;s SAAJ implementation, so it may well be the result of an axis bug.
The payload logging interceptor isn&amp;apos;t logging responses for me, but requests get logged fine.  It turns out that getPayloadSource() was returning null.
I traced it through to getFirstBodyElement(SOAPBody) in Saaj12Implementation:
public SOAPBodyElement getFirstBodyElement(SOAPBody body) {
        for (Iterator iterator = body.getChildElements(); iterator.hasNext() {
            Object child = iterator.next();
            if (child instanceof SOAPBodyElement) 
{
                return (SOAPBodyElement) child;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
The child it found was actually an instance of SOAPElement, not SOAPBodyElement.
	 body.getClass()
	 (java.lang.Class&lt;T&gt;) class org.apache.axis.message.SOAPBody
	 child.getClass()
	 (java.lang.Class&lt;T&gt;) class org.apache.axis.message.MessageElement
public class org.apache.axis.message.MessageElement extends org.apache.axis.message.NodeImpl implements javax.xml.soap.SOAPElement, (etc)
The javadoc for SOAPBody certainly implies that it should be a SOAPBodyElement, but it doesn&amp;apos;t look as if SOAPBodyElement adds anything over SOAPElement so perhaps it can check for and return that instead? 
Thanks,
Brad.
