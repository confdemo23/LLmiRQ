AbstractHttpSenderConnection  getErrorMessage() 
I have situation where AbstractHttpSenderConnection.getResponseMessage() returns null which results in NullPointerException at AbstractHttpSenderConnection.getErrorMessage() due to the construcor of StringBuffer  ( when passed String to the StringBuffer it tries to get it&amp;apos;s length ) I can&amp;apos;t imagine why null is not casted to "null" 
StringBuffer buffer = new StringBuffer(getResponseMessage());
