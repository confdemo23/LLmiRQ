HttpComponentsMessageSender does not set correctly the maximum connections per host for https connection
The following piece of code is used to set the maximum number of connection by route in the method "setMaxConnectionsPerHost":
HttpHost host = new HttpHost(uri.getHost(), uri.getPort(), uri.getScheme());
HttpRoute route = new HttpRoute(host);
This works well for http host but it does not work for https because the route will not be set as "secure".  The following patch seems to work to correct this issue:
if (uri.getScheme().equals("https")) {
     httpRoute = new HttpRoute(httpHost, null, true); 
} else {
    httpRoute = new HttpRoute(httpHost);
}
