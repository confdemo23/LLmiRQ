Soap response validation errors after update to 1.5.7
Upgrade from SpringWS 1.5.6 to 1.5.7 and update.  - No code changes. 
After upgrade error "java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: -1" was thrown during validation. Turning validation off works as a workaround.
my Soap API has 130 calls. Most respones were working fine, not all were tested. I wonder if It might have something to do with the size of the response, all other tested responses were pretty small,  see forum post for bean configurations, errors and response sample.
