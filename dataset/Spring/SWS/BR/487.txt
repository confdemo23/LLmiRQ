CLONE -xml:lang="en" attribute in <faultstring> element is not compliant to SOAP/1.1 schema
There is xml:lang="en" attribute in &lt;faultstring&gt; element although SOAP/1.1 schema doesn&amp;apos;t provide it.
Yes, it may be suppressed if set faultStringOrReasonLocale property for all affected endpoints to null,
set empty language for each and every exception mapping in SoapFaultMappingExceptionResolver (BTW, it is not
very well documented how to do it), set to null faultStringOrReasonLocale for message dispatcher,
oh did I forget something? 
Probably, it may as well be avoided by subclassing of each of above mentioned classes (and likely some others),
but then each developer need to use them. 
See as well http://www.eviware.com/component/option,com_smf/Itemid,53/topic,1044.0
IMHO, or it should comply with schema by default, or, in the worst case, it should exist some global setting 
"be compliant".
Kind regards,
