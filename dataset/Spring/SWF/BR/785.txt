Spring Faces creates XHTML-incompatible JavaScript scripts
Spring Faces creates JavaScript-blocks that are not compatible with XHTMl standards and cause validation errors:
For example the following JSF taglet:
&lt;sf:commandLink styleClass="cmd" id="showDetailData" value="#
{d.firstName}
 #
{d.lastName}
" action="select"/&gt;
creates (among other things) the following JavaScript block:
&lt;script&gt;Spring.addDecoration(new Spring.CommandLinkDecoration(
{elementId : &amp;apos;users:data:24:showDetailData&amp;apos;, linkHtml : users_data_24_showDetailData_link}
));&lt;/script&gt;
This is wrong for several reasons: (a) No type for the script is defined (required by XHTML), (b) The content of the script block is not correctly uncommented in browsers not supporting JavaScript.
The correct block looks like this (type added and correct commenting for all types and versions of browsers added):
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;Unable to render embedded object: File (--//--&gt;&lt;) not found.[CDATA[//&gt;&lt;!--
Spring.addDecoration(new Spring.CommandLinkDecoration(
{elementId : &amp;apos;users:data:1:showDetailData&amp;apos;, linkHtml : users_data_1_showDetailData_link}
));
//--&gt;&lt;!]]&gt; &lt;/script&gt;
Much more verbose but according to our knowledge the only correct way to do it (we will propose a much less verbose style more up to date with current state of the art JavaScript programming later on once we get through the current bugs .
Since we right now are busy with a project for the German public sector, this poses a critical problem for us, since XHTML conformance is required by binding software architecture agreements specified by the German government (SAGA 4.x). Without this conformance it will not be possible to have the system approved by the German government.
