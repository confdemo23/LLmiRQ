org.springframework.faces.webflow.FlowVariableResolver not working with JDK1.4
The FlowVariableResolver is automatically configured by the faces jar (spring-faces-2.0-m4.jar, /META-INF/faces-config.xml). 
In it&amp;apos;s static initializer it tries to create an instance of SpringBeanWebFlowELResolver which inherits from 
org.springframework.beans.factory.access.el.SpringBeanELResolver, but SpringBeanELResolver is not compatible with JDK1.4. 
In turn it might simply be an oversight to make SpringBeanELResolver JDK1.4 compatible (should be fairly easy to replace StringBuilder)?
