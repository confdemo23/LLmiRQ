Flow Id not properly calculated when using "classpath*:" style resources in base-path
I am attempting to define flows in the following manner:
    &lt;webflow:flow-registry id="flowRegistry" base-path="classpath*:/project"&gt;
      &lt;webflow:flow-location-pattern value="/**/webflow.xml"/&gt;
    &lt;/webflow:flow-registry&gt;
I have a webflow.xml in a jar file at the path:
project/proof/create/webflow.xml
Ideally, the flowId would be "proof/create".
When I do this, the flowId ends up being the full url (including the system file path, the jar url protocol, etc). If I change my flow-registry definition to:
    &lt;webflow:flow-registry id="flowRegistry" base-path="classpath:/project"&gt;
      &lt;webflow:flow-location-pattern value="/proof/create/webflow.xml"/&gt;
    &lt;/webflow:flow-registry&gt;
it works fine. However, I lose a lot of flexibility this way (I intend to add many more flows, in multiple jar files).
It seems the culprit is in FlowDefinitionResourceFactory, in the "removeClasspathScheme" method. It strips "classpath:" from the front of the basePath, but doesn&amp;apos;t look for "classpath*:". If I strip the "classpath*:" from the front of the basePath (with a debugger), it works as expected.
