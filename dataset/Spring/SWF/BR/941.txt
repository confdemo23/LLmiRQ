Multiple Fragments not rendering
Multiple fragments are not rendered when specified by a comma separated list.  Adding response.flushBuffer() to line 96 of AjaxTilesView.java seemed to fix the issue.  Comparing revisions it looks as though it was either intentionally or accidently removed in 2.0.4 because a call to request.getSession() was added in it&amp;apos;s place.
Attached file is the patched version.
