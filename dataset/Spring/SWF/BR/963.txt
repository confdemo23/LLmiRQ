Render phase ignores facesContext.responseComplete
It seems that the render response phase of the JSF lifecycle is executed regardless of whether facesContext.responseComplete() has been called before.
Perhaps, JsfView can check for this condition and return without rendering if it is true. 
Also, just from a quick look into it, shouldn&amp;apos;t externalContext.recordResponseComplete be set when facesContext.responseComplete() is called so that a redirect is also prevented?
