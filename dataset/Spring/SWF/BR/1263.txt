Split out JSF 2 specific methods from FlowFacesContext for backwards compatibility with JSF 1.2
While it is generally possible to  use FlowFacesContext in JSF 1.2 because JSF 2 methods (and types) are never called, if the faces context is used in EL expressions in a JSF view, then the introspection causes all declared methods to load their input and output types causing ClassCastException.
