Restore JSF 1.1 compatability for Web Flow 2.0
Spring Web Flow 2.0 M2 introduced a dependency on JSF 1.2.  We should investigate the amount of work required to support JSF 1.1 in Spring Faces, and also the demand for JSF 1.1 from our community.  Please vote on this issue if you require JSF 1.1 beyond March 2008.
