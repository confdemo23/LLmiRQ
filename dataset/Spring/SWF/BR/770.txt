sf:commandLink fails on IE 6 when javascript disabled
When using the sf:commandLink component with javascript disabled the renderer falls back to the ProgressiveCommandButtonRenderer.  This renders &lt;button&gt; elements.
Unfortunately due to a feature of IE 6 button elements are all submitted, regardless of the button that was actually clicked.  (see http://www.kopz.org/public/documents/css/multiple_buttons_ie_workaround.html).  The means that if two links are on the page the action fired might be incorrect.
Could the ProgressiveCommandButtonRenderer be changed to render &lt;input type="submit"&gt; elements instead?
