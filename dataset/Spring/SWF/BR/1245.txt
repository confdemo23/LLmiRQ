Incorrect PhaseListener execution order
JSF 1.1 and 1.2 spec say in the chapter &amp;apos;11.3 PhaseListeners&amp;apos; that "When the lifecycle phase exits, due
to an exception or normal termination, the afterPhase() listeners must be called in
reverse order from the beforePhase() listeners in the following manner."
In Spring Faces, the PhaseListeners beforePhase() and afterPhase() methods are invoked in the same order, not complying the spec.
See org.springframework.faces.webflow.JsfUtils notifyBeforeListeners() and notifyAfterListeners() methods.
