Endless Redirects happens when more then one request Parameter is present on redirect
If you implement your own FlowUrlHandler that re adds request parameter to the url even in case of a redirect you get endless redirects. This is caused by the simple implementation inside the JsfView for UserEvents:
	public boolean userEventQueued() 
{
		return requestContext.getRequestParameters().size() &gt; 1;
	}

Which answers true to having a user event queued if more the one parameter (assuming the one is the flow execution key) is present.  If that request isnt a Ajax request you get a new redirect (and a new and a new). Problem is i could remove the parameters inside our FlowUrlHandlers createFlowExecutionUrl method but then those parameters wouldnt be present at url after the redirect which can lead to wrong bookmarking or wrong behavouir after a reload.
Not sure if this is really a bug from your side. But atleast its a undesireable implementation in my eyes.
