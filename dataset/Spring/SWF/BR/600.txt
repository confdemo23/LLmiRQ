bug in the persistence listener when working with subflows (HibernateFlowExecutionListener)
When entering a subflow with persistence context from a parent woth persistence context you get an 
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Already value [org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.SessionHolder@1 254e59] for key [org.hibernate.impl.SessionFactoryImpl@56b64c] bound to thread [http-8084-4]
When the subflow is started the suspending parent should take care to unbind the session, but this is not being done.
