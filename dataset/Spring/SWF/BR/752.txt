FacesMessage.SEVERITY_FATAL does not propagate through FlowFacesContext
FacesMessage specifies severity of the message as one of
SEVERITY_INFO = new Severity("Info", 1);
SEVERITY_WARN = new Severity("Warn", 2);
SEVERITY_ERROR = new Severity("Error", 3);
SEVERITY_FATAL = new Severity("Fatal", 4);
In FlowFacesContext.addMessage(String clientId, FacesMessage message), the severity of FacesMessage is read and mapped to org.springframework.binding.message.Severity which can be one of
INFO = new Severity(0, "Info");
WARNING = new Severity(1, "Warning");
ERROR = new Severity(2, "Error");
As a matter of fact, FacesMessage.SEVERITY_FATAL is not mapped to its sole value in org.springframework.binding.message.Severity and that causes FATAL messages to be merged with ERROR messages. That is NOT good for applications (like ours , where these two severities have different meanings and processing.
Thank you.
