AjaxTilesView fails to render multiple fragments
We decided to use Spring 3 and Spring Web Flow 2.1.0.M1 to get around Bug SWF-1053 on Tomcat 6.
AjaxTilesView only renders the first fragment when multiple fragments are requested. In 2.0.9 rendering of multiple fragments worked properly.
Our configuration:






&lt;bean id="tilesViewResolver" class="org.springframework.js.ajax.AjaxUrlBasedViewResolver"&gt;




		&lt;property name="order" value="2" /&gt;




		&lt;property name="viewClass"




			value="org.springframework.js.ajax.tiles2.AjaxTilesView" /&gt;




&lt;/bean&gt;






I noticed in 2.0.9 version of AjaxTilesView the line
response.flushBuffer(); was present in renderMergedOutputModel
In 2.1.0.M1 this line is commented out.
When I remove the comment the view works again. We&amp;apos;ve tested with IE6 and Firefox 3.6.3
After some debugging with Firebug I think that I&amp;apos;ve found the problem.
Without the response.flushBuffer(); the server send a Content-length header with the length of the first fragment only. Obviously the browser stops reading the request after the content length has been reached.
With response.flushBuffer();  the response doesn&amp;apos;t contain a  Content-length at all and all fragments get rendered by the browser.
