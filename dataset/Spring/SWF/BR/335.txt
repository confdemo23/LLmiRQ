Remove dependency on OGNL
The implicit constructor of BaseFlowBuilder constructs a BaseFlowServiceLocator which in turn constructors a ExpressionParser using: 
private ExpressionParser expressionParser = DefaultExpressionParserFactory.getExpressionParser();
The problem here is that this makes it impossible to swap the ExpressionParser for a different implementation that doesn&amp;apos;t rely on OGNL. In my case I want to impl an ExpressionParser that using Groovy&amp;apos;s GPath and OGNL is not currently a dependency of Grails nor do I want it to be
