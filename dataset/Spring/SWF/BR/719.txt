Faces does not set components to valid on restore
I believe that during the restore stage of a JSF lifecycle all UIInput components should be set back to a valid state.  Looking at MyFaces 1.1.5 the org.apache.myfaces.lifecycle.RestoreViewExecutor class seems to do this using RestoreStateUtils.recursivelyHandleComponentReferencesAndSetValid.
I have a JSF component to highlight validation failures with a CSS style, this component uses the isValid() component method and now show failures even when a user has corrected them when.  This shows up when they navigate back to a screen.
