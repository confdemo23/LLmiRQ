AjaxTilesView does not resolve deeply nested tiles attributes for rendering as fragments if the containing view has not previously been rendered.
If a particular view has not been previously rendered by a standard JSP request, nested Tiles attributes (i.e., those in a nested definition that is filling in the attribute of a parent definition) will not have been initialized as expected when they are requested for rendering via Ajax.
