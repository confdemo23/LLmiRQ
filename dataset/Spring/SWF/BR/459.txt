Resolution of variables using specific scope prefixes like "flowScope", "flashScope", etc. does not work in JSF views
This is a report from a user against M3.  To investigate.
Also see this comment:
"as of last check if I  wanted to find a variable specifically in flowScope #
{requestContext.flowScope.theVariable}
 It complained that there was no property getTheVariable in localAttributeMap."
