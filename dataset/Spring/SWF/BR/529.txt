DefaultExpressionFactoryUtils breaks backward compatiblity to JDK 1.4
The Method createExpressionFactory() in org.springframework.binding.expression.el.DefaultExpressionFactoryUtils tries to throw an IllegalStateException with arguments of type String and Throwable. 
The Class IllegalStateException in JDK doesn&amp;apos;t allow for an throwable in it&amp;apos;s constructor. This feature is first introduced in JDK1.5
