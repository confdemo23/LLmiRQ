&apos;valid&apos; property of input components gets lost before JSF render phase in portlet
The request cycle of a portlet usually constists of an seperate ActionRequest and RenderRequest.
Spring Faces does bridge these two independant Requests. Specific to the portlet environment the ViewRoot of the JSF component tree is saved at the end of the ActionRequest and restored before JSF enters the render response phase. This way the component tree itself and its state is correcly preserved for rendering. The ViewRoot gets restored in JsfViewFactory.getView(). In this method JsfViewFactory.processTree() also gets called and resets the &amp;apos;valid&amp;apos; property of EditableValueHolder componets to &amp;apos;true&amp;apos;. 
This might be correct before JSF processes the ActionRequest but is NOT correct before JSF enters the render response phase within the RenderRequest. 
The state information of the &amp;apos;valid&amp;apos; property is lost and components whose rendering depend on that property (set to &amp;apos;false&amp;apos; in the ActionRequest because of an validation error) display incorrectly.
