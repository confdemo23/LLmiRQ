FacesMessage.detail does not propagate through FlowFacesContext
Hello !
FacesMessage consists of summary and detail part of message. In FlowFacesContext.addMessage(String clientId, FacesMessage message), the detail value of FacesMessage is not read and saved to RequestContext.messageContext thus its value is thrown away.
One result of this is that validation messages are not displayed correctly when &lt;h:messages showDetail="true"/&gt; is on. Actually, detail holds and shows the value of summary (probably as a result of fallback somewhere in SWF). 
As a matter of fact, many jsf built-in validation and conversion error messages specify detail part of message and those could never be displayed as well.
This issue can be simulated on booking-faces, when &lt;h:messages errorClass="errors" showDetail="true" showSummary="true" /&gt; is used and invalid date is given as input to &amp;apos;Check In Date&amp;apos; assuming that javascript is switched off in browser preferences to disable javascript validations (in IE it can be done on Security tab of Internet Options, attribute &amp;apos;Active scripting&amp;apos;). I provide a diff with changes for quick simulation.
I think this is quite serious issue, because it blocks JSF feature that is quite common even in built-in jsf components.

Off topic: I think that integration of SWF with JSF as well as SWF itself is perfectly done in very clean and concise way. It was a pleasure to traverse through the sources. It shows that you took your time on SWF design. Good job, really!
