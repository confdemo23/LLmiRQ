Trinidad partial rendering not working correctly when used with Spring Faces
Trinidad&amp;apos;s partial rendering features don&amp;apos;t seem to be working correctly in combination with Spring Faces.  A JavaScript error similar to the following is being raised in the browser when the response is returned:
["Invalid PPR response. The response-headers were:\nServer: Apache-Coyote/1.1\nPragma: no-cache\nExpires:..."]DebugCommon1_2_7.... (line 16422)
["Error ", TypeError: responseDocument has no properties message=responseDocument has no properties, " delivering XML request status changed to ", function()]DebugCommon1_2_7.... (line 16422
I was able to reproduce this in a simple Trinidad test project.
