Make FlowExecutionContinuationFactory implementation used by DefaultFlowExecutionRepository configurable
The implementation of the interface FlowExecutionContinuationFactory used by DefaultFlowExecutionRepository is currently hardwired in the constructor. The following is an extract from the M3 source code:
	public DefaultFlowExecutionRepository(ConversationManager conversationManager,
			FlowExecutionStateRestorer executionStateRestorer) 
{
		super(conversationManager, executionStateRestorer, new SerializedFlowExecutionContinuationFactory());
	}

The SerializedFlowExecutionContinuationFactory is directly instantiated and passed to the constructor of the super class. No setter is provided by DefaultFlowExecutionRepository or it&amp;apos;s parent class to inject another implementation of FlowExecutionContinuationFactory.
It would be a great increase of flexibility to allow injection for the FlowExecutionContinuationFactory. This allows it to change the serialization mechanism without being required to re-implement the FlowExecutionRepository.
