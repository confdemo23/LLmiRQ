SessionBindingConversationManager does not update ConversationContainer in HTTP session every time.
The SessionBindingConversationManager does not update the ConversationContainer in the HttpSession every time (for every request). This can give problems in a clustered environment since the servlet engine will not detect any changes in the HttpSession contents and as a result will not push the updated session out to the cluster.
We should also revise the ConversationManager and Conversation interfaces to make sure the have all the hooks required. E.g. how do you know that a client (the FlowExecutionRepo) is done with the ConversationManager, e.g. to commit transaction? Does the unlock() method signal this or do we need another hook?
As a proof of concept we should probably build a DB backed ConversationManager.
