AjaxTilesView composite definition traversal algorithm ignores AttributeType
When looking for a fragment of a composite view to render, the AjaxTilesView traverses nested definitions on the composite.  Unfortunately, it is also treating template and string attributes as definition ids, which can cause the wrong definition to render when the name of the attribute is the same as another, unrelated definition.
The algorithm in AjaxTilesView should only consider definition attributes...
This is a potential security risk as it could allow a client to render unrelated composites outside control of server, so I&amp;apos;m marking it critical for 2.0.7.
