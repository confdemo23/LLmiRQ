FlowFacesContext didn&apos;t expose context messages with null source
In Faces context there is exist method getClientIdsWithMessages().
In your implementation (FlowFacesContext) you didn&amp;apos;t return in this method null source id (IdentifiedMessageCriteria returns false for nulls).
JSF specification say nothing about nulls in return of this method, but several implementation of messages tag relies on this. For instance last versions of MyFaces &lt;h:messages&gt; and RichFaces &lt;rich:messages&gt; behaves that way. As result these implementations didn&amp;apos;t show user messages with null source added to the MessageContext.
The workaround is easy - just allways specify some source id, but better solution would be allow to use null as source.
