Evaluation exceptions caused by type conversion errors within target Expression of a data mapping not treating as a type conversion error
They&amp;apos;re treated as generic "evaluationExceptions" instead... if the root cause of an EvaluationException thrown during data mapping (either get or set) is a conversion exception, a type conversion mapping error should be recorded...
Noticed when error messages were not rendering properly in sample app.
