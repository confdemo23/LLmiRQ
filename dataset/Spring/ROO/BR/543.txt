Multiselect not getting fully selected on update
I have a Researcher object that has many Interests and Skills. When I edit a researcher the skills and interests multiselect boxes do not get correctly bound, so if I just submit they will be almost all erased (all but the first interest). 
The weird thing is that if you view source the correct skills and interests option tags are marked as selected="selected", although they are not highlighted for me as a user and they are not considered selected when I submit the form (because if I submit they are wiped out).
Is there something wrong with dojo MultiSelect widgit? 
You might be able to reproduce the problem with this partial script:
..all of the project and persistence setup
entity --class ~.domain.Interest 
field string --fieldName name
entity --class ~.domain.Skill 
field string --fieldName name
entity --class ~.domain.Researcher 
field set --fieldName interests --element ~.domain.Interest 
field set --fieldName skills --element ~.domain.Skill 
controller scaffold all
If you create a few skills and interests and then create a researcher you should see the problem.
