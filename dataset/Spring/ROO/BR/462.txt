Malformed Query in Finder - Missing AND Token
In some cases And tokens are ignored.
If the first query parameter is an Equals query, isFieldApplied will be set to true upon processing the Equals token. When a subsequent And token is processed, the AND keyword is not appended.
This should occur with other tokens than Equals, but I have not tested them (NotEquals, LessThan, etc.).
