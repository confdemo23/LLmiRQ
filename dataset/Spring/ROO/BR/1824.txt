@Transient Service objects in a @RooEntity cause Web Scaffold to fail
Previously reported by someone in the referenced post, but also causing us problems.  
Given:
@RooJavaBean
@RooEntity
public class Money{
@Autowired
@Transient
private MoneyService moneyService;
... other private fields that map to the db
}
Get "Could not scaffold controller for type Money, the referenced type MoneyService cannot be handled" and roo stops managing the file (or just hangs).
My understanding of ActiveRecord is that the Domain objects should encapsulate their business logic, and in our case that involves interacting with other services.  This service object is not itself a @RooEntity (in our case it has a @Service annotation and is being instantiated via Component Scanning
What causes the related Controller Scaffold to error?
