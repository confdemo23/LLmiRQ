Solr plugin does not allow overriding of methods added to bean
If you attempt to define Bean.indexBean(Collection&lt;Bean&gt; beans) in Bean.java after adding solr to the Bean class, it will cause errors due to the method being declared twice (also in Bean_Roo_SolrSearch.aj). This is different than the way it is done for setters/getters/etc. Redefining this is useful when you only want to search on specific fields.
