@RooJavaBean creates getters+setters for static and/or final fields
The annotation @RooJavaBean creates getters and setters for static fields and for final fields:
@RooJavaBean
public class Foo 
{

  private static String foo = "static";
  private final String bar = "final";

}

This piece of code will create getFoo/setFoo and getBar/setBar. I am not aware if the JavaBeans specification says anything about "static", but the setter for "final" should definitely be skipped. 
Moreover, static final variables do not work at all, Roo will delete the AJ files. This is a problem if serialVersionUID should be specified.
Workaround: declare all fields that should not have an automatic getter/setter as "transient".
