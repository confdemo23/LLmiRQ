ConverterNotFoundException with a ONE_TO_MANY relationship
The attached script sets up my initial attempt at the Composite pattern, with a basic class(component) which is extended by two sub classes (Leaf and Composite). Upon executing the controllers under Tomcat, and adding a Composite, a ConverterNotFound exception is raised upon executing the show.jspx jsp. It seems that the Spring Expression evaluator is complaining about not being able to convert a Set. 
One workaround I have found is to not render the field:display tag in the show.jspx file (render="false").
