Generated application.properties are not sorted
Properties in WEB-INF/i18n/application.properties are not sorted, but in the code there is an attempt to sort them with calls such as 
propFileOperations.addPropertyIfNotExists(Path.SRC_MAIN_WEBAPP, "/WEB-INF/i18n/application.properties", "label" + folderName.replace("/", "") + "" + lcViewName, title, true);
where the last parameter, sorted, is true but has no effects.
