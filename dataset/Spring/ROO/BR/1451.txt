roo generated controllers and scaffolding is unable to support non-numeric keys
I created a few entities and I annotated one of my entity attributes with the @Id annotation and I took off the autogenerated annotation.  I let roo regen the jspx and controller scaffolding and everything seemed fine until I tried to enter a string into the key that contained a "/" in it.  The entity is called gl and the key is called glAccount.  When I attempt to enter the gl of "A/R", the post (create) controller fires as it should then it redirects to "redirect:/gl/"+entity.getGlAccount();  which ends up having a url of GET("/gl/A/R")  which should be "/gl/A%2fR".  Please update the scaffolding to escape the id values when creating links in the tagx files and in the controllers.
