Roo Bootstrap mechanism fails to properly parse multi-argument command line parameters
Launching Roo with the following arguments fails:
classpath:roo-bootstrap.xml script clinic.roo
The failure is caused because the "script clinic.roo" portion is erroneously parsed as "scriptclinic.roo" (note no space).
