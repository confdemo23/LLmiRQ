Controllers created outside toplevel package break the application
I did a &amp;apos;controller all&amp;apos; on a small sample app, but made a typo in the package. The result is that the @Controller classes are generated in the specified package, but since webmvc-config only contains a component-scan directive for @Controller classes under the toplevel package they&amp;apos;re never picked up. Hence all URLs that should be handled by these controllers will go to the default UrlFilenameViewController instead.
Roo should either give an error-msg (seems like the best choice) or add an extra component-scan directive when the user creates controllers outside the toplevel package.
