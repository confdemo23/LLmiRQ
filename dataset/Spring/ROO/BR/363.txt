Perform commands do not work in RC3
Just dowloaded RC3. 
Perform commands seem not to work at all. Same behavior in sts and in standalone roo shell.
Just looks like this:
roo&gt; perform package
roo&gt;
I have Maven 2.10 in my path. 
In previous version (RC2) it did work  (besides the known issue in STS ...)
