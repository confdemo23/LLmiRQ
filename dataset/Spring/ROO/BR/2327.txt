When upgrading from 1.1.2.RELEASE to 1.1.3.RELEASE, the tag files are not updated automatically which results in the application no longer working
addon-web-mvc-jsp
When running 1.1.3.RELEASE for the first time, ROO
Updated SRC_MAIN_WEBAPP/WEB-INF/views/users/list.jspx
and 
Updated ROOT/pom.xml [Updated property 'roo.version' to '1.1.3.RELEASE']
as well as some .aj files.
But I now get the following exception:
Caused by: org.apache.jasper.JasperException: /WEB-INF/views/images/list.jspx(8,177) Attribute dateTimePattern invalid for tag column according to TLD
I realize I can update the tag file myself to remove this error, but ROO should automatically update all tag files if they have not been customized by the user during an upgrade.
