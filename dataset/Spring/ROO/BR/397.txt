Tiles not set up and javax.validation not added to pom when just adding simple controller
When I create a new project with roo and then do something like this:
controller class --name ~web.WelcomeController
I get the Spring-MVC infrastructure set up, but the webmvc-config.xml now refers to the non-existing Tiles configuration (/WEB-INF/layouts/layouts.xml): that layouts directory is not created. BTW, it looks like the pom is properly updated to contain all the Tiles jars. 
This means the application will fail when accessed. 
Also, while trying to reproduce this I encountered another runtime error when running an app built like this:
Caused by: org.springframework.beans.factory.CannotLoadBeanClassException: Error loading class [org.springframework.validation.beanvalidation.LocalValidatorFactoryBean] for bean with name &amp;apos;validator&amp;apos; defined in ServletContext resource [/WEB-INF/config/webmvc-config.xml]: problem with class file or dependent class; nested exception is java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/validation/ValidatorFactory
That should&amp;apos;ve been added to the pom when adding the controller, but apparently wasn&amp;apos;t.
