Support for both MongoDB and a relational datasource at the same time
I see that we cannot have both MongoDB and a relational JPA configuration at the same time.
There are a number of projects that augment their SQL-based stores with NoSQL for reporting, unstructured or semistructured data, etc...
Is it possible to separate out the MongoDB configuration database configuration properties and other settings so that we can mount both relational and non-relational stores in the same application?  Right now I get an error when I try to do this:






org.rooinaction.coursemanager roo&gt; mongo setup 




Created SRC_MAIN_RESOURCES/META-INF/spring/database.properties




Created SRC_MAIN_RESOURCES/META-INF/spring/applicationContext-mongo.xml




Updated ROOT/pom.xml [added repositories http://maven.springframework.org/milestone, https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/releases; added dependencies javax.persistence:persistence-api:1.0, javax.validation:validation-api:1.0.0.GA, org.hibernate:hibernate-validator:4.2.0.Final, org.cloudfoundry:cloudfoundry-runtime:0.8.0, org.springframework.data:spring-data-mongodb:1.0.0.M4]




Updated SRC_MAIN_RESOURCES/META-INF/spring/applicationContext-mongo.xml














org.rooinaction.coursemanager roo&gt; persistence setup --provider HIBERNATE --database DERBY_EMBEDDED 




NullPointerException at org.springframework.roo.addon.jpa.JpaOperationsImpl.updateDatabaseProperties(JpaOperationsImpl.java:475)






I put this in as an enhancement because I&amp;apos;m not sure this was intended as a feature.  
Thanks,
Ken
