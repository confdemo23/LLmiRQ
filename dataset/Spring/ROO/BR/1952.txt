NPE in WebScaffoldMetadata & JspViewManager when version field is removed
When removing a version field from a scaffolded entity with versionField="" WebScaffoldMetadata &amp; JspViewManager throw an exception because FinderMetadata is null.
This can be resolved by moving the finder MD lookup to WebScaffoldMetadataProviderImpl and JspViewManager respectively.
