Roo does not clean up finder methods from UI navigation menu when removed from @RooEntity
Add a finder method to a roo entity.  Update and run, and see the finder method appear in navigation.
Remove the finder method from the @RooEntity annotation in the domain object.  Re-run Roo.  It cleans up the .aj files but does not rework the menu on the UI.
