MVC controller and views not updated when related entity&apos;s plural changes
Found this bug while working on ROO-2839; it&amp;apos;s similar to ROO-2840. To replicate:

Run the vote.roo script.
Edit Choice.java to include the class-level annotation @RooPlural("Options")

Roo updates the Choice-related files:






Updated SRC_TEST_JAVA/com/springsource/vote/domain/ChoiceIntegrationTest_Roo_IntegrationTest.aj




Updated SRC_MAIN_JAVA/com/springsource/vote/web/ChoiceController_Roo_Controller.aj




Updated SRC_MAIN_JAVA/com/springsource/vote/domain/Choice_Roo_Jpa_ActiveRecord.aj




Updated SRC_MAIN_WEBAPP/WEB-INF/views/choices/list.jspx






... but not the Vote-related files, until the shell is restarted:






Updated SRC_MAIN_JAVA/com/springsource/vote/web/VoteController_Roo_Controller.aj




Updated SRC_MAIN_WEBAPP/WEB-INF/views/votes/create.jspx




Updated SRC_MAIN_WEBAPP/WEB-INF/views/votes/update.jspx






Likewise, the same three files are skipped when the annotation is removed.
