Lack of internet connection causes the GWT add-on to hang Roo
In order to determine what is a valid type to use on the client side the GWT add-on checks to see if the referenced type is located in a package that has been declared in the application gwt.xml file. During this check a dtd file is downloaded. If no internet connection is present Roo hangs and the throws a "java.net.UnknownHostException".
