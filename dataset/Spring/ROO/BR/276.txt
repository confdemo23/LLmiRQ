The "field other" comment is inconsistent with other "field" commands
When using field other the field name is specified via a --name option.  For all other field types it is --fieldName.
The --path option is required, even though the command will default to the last used class in the usual way if --class is not specified.  The path must specify the correct maven location or that class won&amp;apos;t be found.
Auto-complete seems to behave differently.
  field string --&lt;tab&gt;  generates a list of the available options
  field other --&lt;tab&gt;  auto-completes --class
Running "help field other" to list the possible options --notNull is not listed.  However --notNull can be specified (but it won&amp;apos;t be auto-completed) and the field will be created with no warning.  However the @NotNull annotation will be missing.  Either notNull is supported and should be available in help and auto-complete, or it should generate a warning that it is being ignore, or an error that it is not supported should be generated.
