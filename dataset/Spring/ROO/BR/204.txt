datepicker semi-language dependent
Just ran clinic.roo script and try to add an owner.
The datepicker widget doesn&amp;apos;t if I set my windows locale to dutch (netherlands). It will pick a date as 14-9-2009 instead of 14-sep-2009. It will say:
Failed to convert property value of type [java.lang.String] to required type [java.util.Date] for property birthDay; nested exception is java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Could not parse date: Unparseable date: "14-9-2009"
may not be null
When changing my locale to english, it works (on IE8, but not in FF3.5).
Also, non-required fields are rejected when not filled in.
