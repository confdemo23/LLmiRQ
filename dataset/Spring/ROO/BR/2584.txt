Arrow keys stop working under Windows 7 with Roo 1.1.5
I just tried to create a new project using Roo 1.1.5 and noticed that the arrow keys no longer work in the command line shell on my Windows 7 laptop. Haven&amp;apos;t checked the sources to see what has changed (JLine, Roo shell code), but it&amp;apos;s very annoying. Same thing for the home and end key and the page up/down, BTW. Under Roo 1.1.4 this problem didn&amp;apos;t exist.
