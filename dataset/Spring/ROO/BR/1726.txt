DBRE fails quietly if database contains certain tablename patterns
1. Create a MSSQL database.
2. Create a table in the default schema "dbo".
3. Name the table with "dbo." prepended to the filename, e.g. "dbo.myTable". So in the database&amp;apos;s table listing the table shows up as "dbo.dbo.myTable".
4. Create other tables as appropriate. 
4. Create a roo project with Hibernate as the persistence provider.
5. Enter "database introspect --schema dbo --file test.xml". The xml file will be created as expected.
7. Enter "database reverse engineer --schema dbo --package ~.foo"
8. .roo-dbre is created and peristence.xml is updated, but that&amp;apos;s it. No entities are created.
Roo script and ddl attached.
Not a naming scheme one would wisely or typically employ, but the resulting behavior is unexpected and confusing.
