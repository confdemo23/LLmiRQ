Provide transaction manager name for Transactional annotation in aspect generated by RooEntity
@RooEntity doesn&amp;apos;t have an option to properly configure the @Transactional annotation. So, we think at least it should allow you to define a @Transactional("name of TxMgr") in the aspect via some @RooEntity property.
Thanks
