GWT application that previously ran on Google App Engine does not run when persistence switched back to SQL database
Run expenses.roo and switch persistence to GAE. Also run web gwt gae update. App runs OK in GAE, however, when persistence is changed back Hibernate and H2 for example, the app does not run with mvn gwt:run. The gwt-maven-plugin is not updated back to GWT version and a compile error






expenses/src/main/java/org/springsource/roo/extrack/client/scaffold/gae/GaeHelper.java:16:0::0 The constructor GaeLoginWidgetDriver(ApplicationRequestFactory) is undefined






If the intended behaviour is that there is no way back from GAE, then close off as won&amp;apos;t fix
