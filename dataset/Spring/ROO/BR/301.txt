Choose between data access patterns
At this time, the Aspect J generated aspects and entity classes follow the Active Record pattern. 
It would be nice if we could choose between this pattern and Data Access Object, with or without Spring DaoSupport. The way to configure would be "persistence setup ... --databaseAccessPattern ActiveRecord|DAO".
