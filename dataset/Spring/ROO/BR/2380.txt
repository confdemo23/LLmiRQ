Customized ui.xml files overwritten by Roo
Roo Guide 12.5 states, "Roo looks for an element that has an "id=boundElementHolder" attribute, if a "boundElementHolder" element is not found Roo leaves the file."
Despite this, editing this id to "cisElementHolder" in *DetailView.ui.xml and *EditView.ui.xml does not prevent customizations to these files from being overwritten by Roo including setting the id back to boundElementHolder.
