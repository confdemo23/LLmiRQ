Error when using the &apos;field embedded&apos; command 
Upon using the &amp;apos;field embedded&amp;apos; command, I ran into the following error/warning: "The field embedded command is only applicable to JPA @Entity target types". I&amp;apos;ve checked my classes and the target type had the @RooEntity annotation, so I guess this should work. I&amp;apos;ve temporarily replaced that annotation with the @Entity annotation, performend the same &amp;apos;field embedded&amp;apos; command without any problems. Changing the annotation then again back to &amp;apos;@RooEntity&amp;apos; worked fine and even the unit tests kept working, so not much of a problem, but still a bit of a strange annoyance.
