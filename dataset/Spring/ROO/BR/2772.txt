Cannot rename DBRE fields
After reverse eng. I push-in a field in "DbManaged.aj" to "Entity.java" and when I rename the pushed-in field, it is created again in "DbManaged.aj"
To reproduce:

Create test DB. Attached .sql to create it
Run attached .roo script
Go to Areagroups_Roo_DbManaged.aj and push-in field "areass"
Go to Areagroups.java and rename "areass" to "areas"
