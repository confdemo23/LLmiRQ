ROO managed applications are susceptible to XSS attacks
Generate an application using the following commands:
project --topLevelPackage com.bloudraak.sample.xss
persistence setup --provider HIBERNATE --database MYSQL 
entity --class ~.models.Item --table items
field string --fieldName title 
field string --fieldName body --sizeMax 4096
controller all --package ~.controllers
exit
Start the application by executing "mvn tomcat:run".  Create a new "Item" and enter "&lt;script&gt;alert(&amp;apos;Hello Dude&amp;apos;)&lt;/script&gt;" in the description field and save.  Notice a dialog appearing that says "Hello Dude".  Also note that when listing all items, the website is "broken". 
Also note that I can "break" the application by entering an HTML comment, such as "&lt;!--". 
You can find a few things to check for using this cheat sheet   I would strongly suggest that ROO generates tests to cover these cases so that a developer knows when he breaks the security.
