Setting method names to blank on @RooEntity does not prevent those methods from being generated
Setting methods names to blank on @RooEntity does not prevent those methods from being generated the same way versionField="" does, the settings appear to be ignored.
My specific requirement is to make an Entity read only (persistMethod="", removeMethod="", mergeMethod="") but all of the method name attributes should probably work the same way.
