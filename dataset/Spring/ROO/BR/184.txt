Dropdown disappears after validation error
Dropdown controls disappear from forms upon validation errors. This appears to be a problem with the AspectJ controller files generated by Spring Roo generally. The petclinic sample application provides one example. Specifically, the "createForm" method in the auto-generated file OwnerController_Roo_Controller.aj maps "pets" to the result set from a call to ~.domain.Pet.findAllPets(); but this mapping does not occur in the "create" method prior to returning with the String "owner/create." Consequently, the pets model object is lost in the process of returning from validation.
