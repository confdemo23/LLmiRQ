Dependencies not added using ProjectOperations.dependencyUpdate when switching ORM provider or databases
Change JpaOperationsImpl  to add dependencies instead of updating them. Problem is due to having a property place holder for a version number rather than a number itself. The equals() method in dependency sees the dependency as the same.
