DBRE multiple schema support
At the moment we allow only one database schema per project in DBRE.
What is the problem to support multiple? For instance:






database reverse engineer --schema SCHEMA_1 --package ~.model.schema1




database reverse engineer --schema SCHEMA_2 --package ~.model.schema2






At the moment second script command wipes out all generated artifacts created by first command.
