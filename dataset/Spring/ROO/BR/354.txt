Dependencies incorrectly parsed when unexpected <type> element appearing in pom.xml
I&amp;apos;ve changed some part of my pom.xml with Eclipse editor, something like add new Plugin and properties or Tabbed some dependencies for putting them in right format.
Now after create a new Controller then pom.xml will include 10 repeated dependencies.
