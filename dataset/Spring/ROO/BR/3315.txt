Roo cannot handle a multi-catch try-catch block.
As described in ROO-3314 Roo simply cannot handle a multi-catch try-catch block.
Add the following code (using JDK 1.7) in any class to reproduce:
		try
{
			if(true) throw(new InstantiationException());
			throw(new IllegalAccessException());
		}
 catch(InstantiationException | IllegalAccessException e)
		{	
		}
Add the following code for the second similar error I mentioned:
		new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
