Not all current types in java.lang correctly recognized by JavaParserUtils
The @RooJavaBean creates invalid fully qualified package names for Iterable:
package foo.bar.baz;
import org.springframework.roo.addon.javabean.RooJavaBean;
@RooJavaBean
public class X {
  Iterable&lt;Object&gt; it;
}
produces a ITD with a method with the following declaration:
 public foo.bar.baz.Iterable&lt;java.lang.Object&gt; X.getIt()
For a other types sitting in java.lang, e.g., String the declaration is correct and refers to java.lang.String. As JavaBeanMetadata#getDeclaredGetter currently simply copies the type of the getter&amp;apos;s field as its return type, I assumed that JavaParser&amp;apos;s knowledge of java.lang is incomplete.
