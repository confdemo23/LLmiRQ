GWT add-on does not respect paths in a multi-module project
In a multi-module project where GWT scaffolding is required in a module, the GWT add-on creates artifacts in the root module of the project as well as the intended module. This is due to the use of focused project calls, when it should use the path of the actual module where the GWT scaffolding is required.
