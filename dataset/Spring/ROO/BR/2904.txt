Roo nightly builds have broken auto-complete with STS console
Affected version post 1.2.0M1
It appears that with the recent builds of the Roo Shell, Parser#complete now takes a list of Completions instead of a list of Strings, and this is breaking compatibility with existing implementations of the STS console integration. Would it be possible to make this change in a binary backwards compatible manner? Instead of changing the signature of the existing method, perhaps introduce a new method and keep the older one functional?
