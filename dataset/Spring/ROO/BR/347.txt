TilesOperations fails on Windows with spaces in path and also consumes root exceptions
If you run script vote.roo on Windows from an empty directory that appears in a path containing a space, you get:
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unable to parse the tiles C:\springsource\roo-1
.0.0.RC2\vote 3\src\main\webapp\WEB-INF\views\views.xml file
    at org.springframework.roo.addon.mvc.jsp.TilesOperations.&lt;init&gt;(TilesOperations.java:94)
    at org.springframework.roo.addon.security.SecurityOperations.installSecurity(SecurityOperations.java:87)
The real root exception is also swallowed by the handling approach of:
} catch (Exception e) {
  throw new IllegalStateException("Unable to parse the tiles " + viewFile + " file");
}
It would probably be useful to retain the root exception and pass it to the IllegalStateException constructor.
