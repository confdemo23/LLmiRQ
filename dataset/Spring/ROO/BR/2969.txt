Some Roo annotations are retained at runtime
I found while testing Spring 3.1 for ROO-2894 that the following Roo annotations have the default retention, i.e. java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME:

RooGwtLocator
RooJpaEntity
RooWebFinder
RooWebJson

Obviously this violates the core Roo design goal of the user project having no runtime dependencies upon Roo itself.
