ApplicationConversionServiceFactoryBean does not set all Converters
When overwriting some Converters for some classes in ApplicationConversionServiceFactoryBean the default roo-generated converters for the other classes are ignored.
A Workaround is to copy all Converters to the ApplicationConversionServiceFactoryBean.
