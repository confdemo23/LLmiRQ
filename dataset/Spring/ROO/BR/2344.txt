JpaOperationsImpl is not removing Plugins from ProjectOperations when carrying out a Plugin removal
JpaOperationsImpl removes a Plugin from the pom.xml file but doesn&amp;apos;t convey this change to ProjectOperation causing the Plugin state in ProjectOperation to be become out of sync and PluginListeners not be to notified.
