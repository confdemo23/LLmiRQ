"web flow" command does not add required message codes to application.properties

Create a project without Spring Web Flow (e.g. run vote.roo)
Run the "web flow" shell command; note that the shell does not update the application.properties message bundle:

Run the application and go to http://localhost/vote
The home page fails to load, with this error in the server log:






No message found under code &amp;apos;menu_category_flows_label&amp;apos; for locale &amp;apos;en&amp;apos;.







If you add this code to application.properties and restart the application, another message code is reported as missing:






No message found under code &amp;apos;menu_item_sampleflow_label&amp;apos; for locale &amp;apos;en&amp;apos;.






And if you fix that, you get:






No message found under code &amp;apos;Sampleflow&amp;apos; for locale &amp;apos;en&amp;apos;.
