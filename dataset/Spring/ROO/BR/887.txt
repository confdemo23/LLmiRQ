Make logging compile out of generated scaffold apps
Improvements to logging that are scheduled for M4
Todo: Confirm that logging in scaffold compiles out when logging is disabled
Done: Make sure logging example is in dist
Done: Show de-obfuscated stack traces in the RequestFactoryRemoteLogHandler
Done: Send Json across the wire rather than just messages
Done: Show stack traces in the client side handlers as appropriate
Done: Move LoggingRequest to RF subclasses
Done: Fix the logging example
Not Planned: Send a LogRecord accross the wire rather than Json (this is blocked on ability to send arbitrary objects across the wire which will not be implemented for this release)
Not Planned: Make RFRLogHandler able to send multiple LogRecords accross the wire, and have it send logs every X seconds rather than right away. Instead, we will just get this for free when RF starts to do batching of all requests.
