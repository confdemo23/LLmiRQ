Roo generated finder has a sql syntax error in it
Copying over from STS-626:
I am using PSQL and hibernate for persistence.
I generated a finder to find Researchers by Interests. The Roo generated finder has a SQL error in it (look for WHERE AND). Here is the generated method:






public static Query Researcher.findResearchersByInterests(Set&lt;Interest&gt; interests) {




   if (interests == null) throw new IllegalArgumentException("The interests argument is required");




   EntityManager em = Researcher.entityManager();




   StringBuilder queryBuilder = new StringBuilder("SELECT Researcher FROM Researcher AS researcher WHERE AND");




   for (int i = 0; i &lt; interests.size(); i++) { 




      if (i &gt; 0) queryBuilder.append(" AND"); 




      queryBuilder.append(" :interests_item").append(i).append(" MEMBER OF researcher.interests"); 




   }




   Query q = em.createQuery(queryBuilder.toString());




   int i = 0;




   for (Interest interest: interests) { 




      q.setParameter("interests_item" + i++, interest); 




   }




   return q;




}






When I try to use this finder in my app i get a org.hibernate.hql.ast.QuerySyntaxException: unexpected token: AND near line 1, column 81 [SELECT Researcher FROM edu.drexel.goodwin.domain.Researcher AS researcher WHERE AND :interests_item0 MEMBER OF researcher.interests]
That word AND shouldn&amp;apos;t be right after the WHERE.
