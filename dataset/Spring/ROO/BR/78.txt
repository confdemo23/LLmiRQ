Support for array types in parser
Roo&amp;apos;s parser apparently has problems when dealing with array types:
@RooJavaBean
public class Foo 
{

  private String bar[];

}

will produce the following aspect, not recognizing that bar is an array:
privileged aspect Foo_Roo_JavaBean {
    public java.lang.String at.telekomaustria.zusdie.xml.Foo.getBar() 
{    
        return this.bar;        
    }
 
    public void at.telekomaustria.zusdie.xml.Foo.setBar(java.lang.String bar) 
{    
        this.bar = bar;        
    }
 
}
The alternative array syntax "String[] bar;" causes the whole aspect to be deleted, apparently because of a parsing failure.
Parser and code generation should support all legal Java array type declarations, as defined in the JLS 10.2, also nasties such as "byte[] rowvector, colvector, matrix[];"
