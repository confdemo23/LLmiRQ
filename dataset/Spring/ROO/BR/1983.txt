JavaBeanMetadata creates an AspectJ file with an "Employee" type
In certain cases, Roo may generate an AspectJ file implementing the JavaBean properties that contains a hard-coded "Employee" type.  See the referenced forum posting for details and script file that can be used to duplicate the issue.
Attached is what I assume is the fix, a one-liner patch file.  I haven&amp;apos;t built the source to confirm this yet, but will do so and update this afterwards.
