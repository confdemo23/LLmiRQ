create.jspx and update.jspx missing fields from entity
When creating an entity with a ManyToOne relationship, the create.jspx and update.jspx for the entity at the One end of the relationship does not include a UI component for the Many end. This is fine, but sometimes when an entity includes this type of relationship then other fields (for example, of type string) are not generated.
There appears to be a bug in:
https://anonsvn.springframework.org/svn/spring-roo/release-1.0.0.RELEASE/addon-web-mvc-jsp/src/main/java/org/springframework/roo/addon/mvc/jsp/JspDocumentHelper.java
In the createFieldsForCreateAndUpdate() method. See line 674. There is a return statement which would stop the generation of any subsequent fields.
