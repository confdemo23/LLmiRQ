Executing commands via OS CLI argument causes Felix classloading failure
Using roo-dev "script vote.roo" would result in an "ERROR: JarContent: Unable to read bytes. (java.lang.IllegalStateException: zip file closed)" error consistent with https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FELIX-2128 as Felix had already shutdown before the background ProcessManager thread had completed execution.
