Two unrelated classes synchronise on same Boolean constant
These two classes use the same instance of the Boolean class (i.e. Boolean.TRUE) as their "lock" synchronisation field:

org.springframework.roo.classpath.scanner.MemberDetailsScannerImpl
org.springframework.roo.file.monitor.polling.PollingFileMonitorService

This inadvertent coupling of two unrelated classes could lead to unresponsiveness and possible deadlock.
