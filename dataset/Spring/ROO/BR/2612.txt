Entity .merge() method should be generified to accomodate inheritance
In the clinic.roo example, the Owner and Vet entities inherit their merge() methods from the AbstractPerson superclass. However, since that method is not generifed, it actually returns an AbstractPerson rather than an Owner or Vet, meaning that the following code will not compile:






Owner updatedOwner = owner.merge();
