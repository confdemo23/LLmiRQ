The GWT add-on is not following standard Roo conventions
In Roo annotating a type would enable a piece of functionality and cause changes to the project, and the opposite would occur when removing the annotation. This is not the case for the GWT add-on which mirrors all entities found instead of making use of the @RooGwtMirroredBean annotation as originally intended.
