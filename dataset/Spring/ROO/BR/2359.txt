Finder AspectJ MEMBER OF select statement format incorrect
Upgraded from 1.1.2 to 1.1.3 finders have been changed so that now using o rather than the entity name e.g.
SELECT o FROM EntityName AS o WHERE ...
rather than:
SELECT EntityName FROM EntityName AS EntityName WHERE ...
as for 1.1.2
This is fine but the MEMBER of statement has not been updated when referencing a collection within the entity e.g.
1.1.2 code:
SELECT entityName FROM EntityName AS entityName WHERE :member_item0 MEMBER OF entityName.members
1.1.3 code:
SELECT o FROM EntityName AS o WHERE :member_item0 MEMBER OF entityName.members
this should be:
SELECT o FROM EntityName AS o WHERE :member_item0 MEMBER OF o.members
The fix for this is to move affected finders into entity class and make appropriate changes.
