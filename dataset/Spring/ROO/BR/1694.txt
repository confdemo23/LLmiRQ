Roo aborts AJ processing without explanation
When Roo encounters a JPA @Id field that does not have a public setter, it complains on the shell.  (This is questionable behavior itself, since the ID field may be managed some "magic" way, as in the case of a Hibernate foreign-key ID generator.)
It appears that encountering this situation causes Roo to abort processing and creating/managing AJ files, but Roo provides no indication of this fact; it merely fails silently because of an apparently unrelated issue.  Instead, if for some reason of internal plumbing Roo really can&amp;apos;t continue, it should inform the user.
