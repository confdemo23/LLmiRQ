LayerTypeMatcher is incorrectly implemented
LayerTypeMatcher is currently matching on an ITD&amp;apos;s MID, despite being interested in a type. Once a matching ITD is discovered the actual target, the ITD&amp;apos;s governor, is extracted. This is fine to do when the target doesn&amp;apos;t contain the information you need, i.e. the ITD is created based on no information present in the governor, but this is a pretty unusual case as most ITDs are created via trigger annotations on the governor. The correct approach would be to match on an attribute found in the target, in this case an annotation on governor type.
