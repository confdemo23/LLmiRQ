"add field string -regexp" does not escape backslashes
The add field string -regexp literally uses the value behind the -regexp argument as the string associated with @Pattern(regexp) in the Java Source code.
Therefore, backslashes are up to interpretation for Java, which means that a regular expression like \w causes an error "invalid escape sequence". IMHO, this violates the principle of least surprise for the users of the Roo shell.
