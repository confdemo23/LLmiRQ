DBRE model not updated when XML file is edited manually while shell is running
Though it is not recommended that the DBRE xml file be edited by the user (analogous to editing ITDs), there exists inconsistent behaviour now where if the file is edited, no updates occur until the Roo shell is restarted. This change will trigger changes to the ITDs when the XML file is edited while the Roo shell is running also.
As part of the change the DbreDatabaseListener will be refactored to be a FileEventListener instead of a DatbaseListener. This simpflifies the code significantly.  
The .roo-dbre will also be renamed dbre.xml and be moved to src/main/resources. Roo does not listen for files starting with a period and this would be problematic for the FileEventListener
