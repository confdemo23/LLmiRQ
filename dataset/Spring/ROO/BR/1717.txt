Standard Scaffold controller methods defined in parent class are not detected
I have a Roo Controller class called Foo with scaffolding and there is a list method in the FooController_Roo_Controller aspect. If I implement list in my Foo class then Roo detects it and removes it from the aspect as expected.
If I now move that list method up into an Abstract base class called ParentOfFoo and change Foo so that it extends ParentOfFoo then Roo puts back the list method into the aspect. This is not what I expect.
Can we change Roo to detect methods implemented by base classes please?
