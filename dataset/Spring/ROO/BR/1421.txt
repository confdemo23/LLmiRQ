AspectJ very slow in STSM3 after running DBRE
I ran DBRE from an MSSQL 2008 database of 430 tables (and fair amount of relationships/FPKs).
All was fine until I restarted roo (using roo-dev M4). Everything is very slow: roo command line and STS aspect compilation; and consumes tons of memory. I had increase STS memory to 4G.
My questions are:
1. Have I exceeded table count limit?
2. Is there another way work with DBRE project of this size - is size the issue?
3. Is there a way to customize _Roo_DbManaged to use foreign keys instead of relationship annotations - I think this the culprit?
