ItdTypeDetailsBuilder requires abstract methods to have a body
o.s.r.classpath.details.ItdTypeDetailsBuilder.onAddMethod(MethodMetadataBuilder) requires the passed-in method builder to specify a method body, which is incorrect for abstract methods (e.g. those being introduced into an interface).
This bug only affects developers of addons that generate an ITD that introduces an abstract method.
The workaround is to add a dummy body as follows:






MethodMetadataBuilder methodBuilder = ... // obtain or create as normal (for an abstract method)




methodBuilder.getBodyBuilder().appendFormalLine("anything"); // this line will not appear in the generated ITD, as the method is abstract
