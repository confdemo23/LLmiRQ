web.xml filter ordering can create locale/language character encoding issues
when I type a text like :
etta er i texti
Spring (on submit) changes the text to : 
etta er i texti
everything seems to be in UTF-8 but somewhere after submit the text entered gets garbled (or changed between character sets)
This also translates to database, that is the garbled text gets written to the database.
My workaround for this so far is copying a roo project that I had in version 2.5.1.release
which doesnt seem affected by this problem, deleting all objects there and using that as a base (instead of creating a new roo project in sts 2.5.2 or 2.6.0 release)
