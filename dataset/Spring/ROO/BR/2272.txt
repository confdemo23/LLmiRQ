DBRE across multiple schemas
Is common in large organizations to have DB schemas where tables have relations with tables in other schemas or catalogs.
Would be great that Roo DBRE supports this kind of scenarios. We&amp;apos;re trying to evangelize Roo and a workaround making reverse engineering in several steps (pushing all the fields in the _DBManaged ITD to the java file in each step) is not the best solution.
