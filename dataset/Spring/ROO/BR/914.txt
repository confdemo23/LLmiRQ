Oracle persistence: wrong URL in database.properties
After having create a topLevelPackage for a new roo project and after executing the persistence setup with
persistence setup --provider ECLIPSELINK --database ORACLE --databaseName orcl --userName oe --password  oe
(OE is a default test-schema delivered from Oracle for testing and training purposes)
the created database.properties contains a wrong URL:
jdbc\:oracle\:thin\:@localhost\:1521/orcl
The correct one should not contain any slashes/backslashes and is of the following form (maintaining the replacements):
jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:orcl
Having replaced that, the database connection works.
