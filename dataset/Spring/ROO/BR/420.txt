Roo fails to start on windows with an installed addon
After a plugin is deployed Roo-Dev fails to start with the following error:
    java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/springframework/roo/shell/CommandMarker
This is a problem with a classpath which is caused by the use of "-Djava.ext.dirs" system property in the roo-dev.bat to load addons. 
A way to fix this issue is to load addons on the classpath using Java 6 classpath wildwards:
  rem Append addons and jre\lib\ext to the classpath, (Java 6+ is required)
  set EXT_DIRS=%USERPROFILE%\roo-dev\work*;%JAVA_HOME%\jre\lib\ext*
  set ROO_CP=%ROO_CP%;%EXT_DIRS%
Then just remove the use of "-Djava.ext.dirs"
  java -Djline.nobell=true -DdevelopmentMode=true %ROO_OPTS% -Droo.home="%USERPROFILE%\roo-dev" -cp %ROO_CP% org.springframework.roo.bootstrap.Bootstrap "classpath:/roo-bootstrap.xml" %*
The only downside to this solution is Java 6+ dependency as it utilizes classpath wildcards.
