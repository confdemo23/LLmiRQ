Flawed persistence when using Hypersonic
When using a persistent Hypersonic database (via persistence setup --provider HIBERNATE --database HYPERSONIC_PERSISTENT), two artifacts should be generated differently:
(1) META-INF/spring/database.properties: the connection string should contain the parameter ;shutdown=true, so that HSQLDB correctly writes any changes to disk when you stop Tomcat
(2) persistence.xml: the default setting for hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto should be update
Everything else will lead to side-effects which a user will not expect from a persistent setup.
Apart from that ... keep up the great work! I&amp;apos;m excited to see where Roo will go.
