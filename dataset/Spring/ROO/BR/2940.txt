jsf managed bean generation fails (using 2 many-to-many fields)
When running the attached script which generates 1 object which holds 2 sets referencing (many_to_many) a second object, it fails to generate some method/variable names correctly in the xxxBean_Roo_ManagedBean.aj file.
E.g. xxx.getStreets() instead of xxx.getFirstStreetSet() 
also xxx.selectedFirstStreetSet and xxx.selectedSecondStreetSet vars get referenced by 2 "selectedStreets" references
note: I couldn&amp;apos;t issue "entity jsf" commands via STS due to another bug, it worked from the command line though
