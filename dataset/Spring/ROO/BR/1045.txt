Big performance problems with roo shell
Having a project with about 90 entities (not big ones), integration tests and controllers make roo shell hang up for about 20-40 minutes when starting, with the CPU at 100%.
I have created a basic roo script creating 100 entities with only 5 fields in each and without any relations. It also creates the controllers and the integration tests.
After the script is done, just exit roo and start the shell again and it start consuming CPU and hanging. Just type &amp;apos;hint&amp;apos; and it&amp;apos;s only when you get the prompt back that roo becomes enable. Then, when you do some manual changes in entities, roo has really some trouble identifying and applying changes.
We have decided to use roo to develop our new application, but if this issue can&amp;apos;t be resolved (or at lease have a workaround), we&amp;apos;ll have to continue without roo.
