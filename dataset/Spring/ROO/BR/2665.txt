EntityMetadataProviderImpl fails to find the parent EntityMetadata in certain circumstances
In certain circumstances EntityMetadataProviderImpl incorrectly returns a parent EntityMetadata as null. It is perfectly valid for an EntityMetadata not to have a parent EntityMetadata but in some cases it indicates that not enough information is ready to proceed with metadata creation. In the case of EntityMetadata if the governor has a super class and said super class is annotated with @RooEntity the parent EntityMetadata the parent should be resolved and not null. If the parent EntityMetadata is null this indicates a problem and null should be returned instead of continuing as if the EntityMetadata to be produced doesn&amp;apos;t have a parent.
