EditorMetadata erroneously attempts to introduce various members when they are already defined in the target type
Similar to ROO-328, the EditorMetadata erroneously attempts to introduce various members when they are already defined in the target type. This is exhibited when undertaking a push-in refactor. The Roo ITDs should never contain members separately provided in the standard .java file. The Roo system correctly reports the error on the console, but the property editor add-on next to be fixed to not attempt this in the first place.
