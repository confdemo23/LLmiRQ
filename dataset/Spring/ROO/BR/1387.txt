ConverterNotFoundException: No converter found
Using a dynamic finder for a domain entity produces an exception iff the finder method was called prior to creating or listing any entities of this type.
ConverterNotFoundException: No converter found capable of converting from &amp;apos;com.springsource.petclinic.domain.Owner&amp;apos; to &amp;apos;java.lang.String&amp;apos;
Steps to reproduce:
1. use sample project petclinic
2. setup persistence
3. start application
4. add an Owner entity
5. restart application
6. directly use finder Pet.findPetsByOwner (through petclinic/pets?find=ByOwner&amp;form)
7. exception occurs
org.springframework.core.convert.ConverterNotFoundException: No converter found capable of converting from &amp;apos;com.springsource.petclinic.domain.Owner&amp;apos; to &amp;apos;java.lang.String&amp;apos;
at org.springframework.core.convert.support.GenericConversionService.convert(GenericConversionService.java:180)
...
The exception does not occur if entities of the searched type were created or listed prior to using the finder.
It just happens at application start.
It seems that the @InitBinder annotated method in the _Roo_Controller is not called.
