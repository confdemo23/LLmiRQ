Infinite loop if JavaTypePersistenceMetadataDetails for co-dependent entities cannot be created
If a JavaTypePersistenceMetadataDetails cannot be created, in my case the identifier accessor field could not be found, for an entity which is depended on by an entity which in turn is also depended on by the JavaTypePersistenceMetadataDetails-less entity an infinite loop is occurs. The standard behaviour should be that a partial Metatdata is created and then is revisited, this would occur if the lack of JavaTypePersistenceMetadataDetails was ignored and Metadata creation proceeds.
