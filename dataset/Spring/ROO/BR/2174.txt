null initialized String field in entity throws indexoutofboundsexception : -1
One of many Roo generated entities contained a String field which I added myself and for some reason initialized to null.
The result is that the data on demand component blows up @
DataOnDemandMetadata.storeFieldInitializers(DataOnDemandMetadata.java:640)
From the look of the code, I think this be pretty easy to reproduce, initialize a String field in an entity to null, stop roo, start roo. 
This really bricked everything for me, no code updates were being done anymore by roo and I had no clue what was going on basically. 
On great addition would be to more logging, allow through some means a user to enable logging of which files, fields, ... are being processed, relevant status and results etc. This would have saved quite some hours.
