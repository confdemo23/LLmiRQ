"Too many open files" on controller generation
I&amp;apos;ve been trying to model a project which has quite an amount of domain objects and when it comes to the generation of controllers (controller all --package ~.web) I get this error:
Created SRC_MAIN_WEBAPP/WEB-INF/views/controlpots/create.jspx

[Timer-0] /tmp/UpdateFile4795595304280762163tmp (Too many open files)
The open file limit on my box had been set to 1024 which should really suffice for a desktop system.  However, I have raised it to 8192 for further tests and am still getting an error a few seconds after the script appeared to have finished.

Then I have run the same script with 1.0.2 to compare the number of files held open by the roo process.
1.1.0M2:
...
java      5586      arkay 3453r      REG               8,34     33308  6578003 
/home/arkay/Java/TheGuitarListRoo/TheGuitarList/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/i18n/application.properties
java      5586      arkay 3454r      REG               8,34     33308  6578003 
/home/arkay/Java/TheGuitarListRoo/TheGuitarList/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/i18n/application.properties
arkay@gentoodesk ~ $ lsof -p 5586 | grep application.properties | wc -l
6942
1.0.2:
arkay@gentoodesk ~ $ lsof -p 5792 | grep application.properties | wc -l
66
Those numbers were obtained after my roo script had finished.  There seems to be a File object leak somewhere, otherwise I can&amp;apos;t explain the 6942 open files held by 1.1.0M2 vs. the 69 the last release version used.
