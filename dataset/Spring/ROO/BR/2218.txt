Exception thrown when searching for non-existent /div/page element in index-template.jspx
The element from XPath expression "/div/page" does not exist in index-template.jspx and as a result an exception is caught and re-thrown. This was masked prior to ROO-2210 as the IllegalStateException was instantiated instead of being correctly thrown. Processing just continued on as normal.
