Member holding type details required
I&amp;apos;m working with spring roo 1.1.4 but I have a problem when I generate the model who is compound of several schemas. The spring roo console shows this:
Foreign key table for foreign key &amp;apos;update_by_table_in_another_schema__users&amp;apos; in table &amp;apos;users&amp;apos; must not be null in determining a one-to-one relationship
I have a user schema who has the table user, roles, roles_user and another business schema. In a table of my business schema I have a foreign key to table user of the users schema.
I tested the "database reverse enginner" with only one schema and this created the model classes without problems.
what Can I do? I have to work with only a schema
Thanks
