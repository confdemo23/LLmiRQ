UnsupportedOperationException adding items to AbstractMemberHoldingTypeDetailsBuilder if unmodifiable list previously set
Found this by code inspection rather than at runtime, so it may not be causing any problems at the moment.
See the new test case AbstractMemberHoldingTypeDetailsBuilderTest for the various failure scenarios. In short, an UnsupportedOperationException is thrown upon this sequence of calls:






AbstractMemberHoldingTypeDetailsBuilder builder = ...; // get a concrete instance




List foos = ....; // get an unmodifiable list of Foos to add, e.g. via Collections#singletonList




builder.setFoos(foos);




Foo anotherFoo = ...;




builder.addFoo(anotherFoo); // !!! throws an UnsupportedOperationException






This bug happens because of poor encapsulation within AbstractMemberHoldingTypeDetailsBuilder, in that lists passed to setters are stored internally rather than being defensively copied. Therefore when you set an unmodifiable list, it can&amp;apos;t be modified later by calling the relevant "add" method.
