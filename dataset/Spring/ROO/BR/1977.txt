Intermittent Process Manager lock-ups
People loading Roo are intermittently experience lock-ups where Roo reports it is "still loading". This is similar to ROO-1974, although the problem can be reproduced with zero files in the current working directory. As such I am logging it as a separate bug, so we can address the specifics in ROO-1974 separately.
