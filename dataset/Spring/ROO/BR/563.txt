"finder list" only listing "NOT" option for boolean field
Exactly as I wrote in the forum.
Hi guys!
I&amp;apos;ve got an entity that has a boolean field.
When I type the command "finder list" in Roo Shell, it only lists the corresponding finder with the NOT modifier. For example:
Let&amp;apos;s suppose an entity named "Foo" with a boolean field named "enabled", if I type the command "finder list", Roo will show:
.....
findFoosByEnabledNot(Boolean enabled)
...
And not the option
...
findFoosByEnabled(Boolean enabled)
...
Nevertheless Roo only doesn&amp;apos;t list it, because if I type:
...
finder add --finderName findFoosByEnabled
Roo effectively generates the corresponding code.
What I&amp;apos;m pointing in this post is that this situation is a bit confusing and sometimes funny, in my case i used the findFoosByEnabledNot option and of course it was listing the opposite option I was looking for!!!!
I&amp;apos;m submitting the corresponding JIRA later
