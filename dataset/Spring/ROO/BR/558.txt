Need support for @IdClass
We need @RooEntity to support @IdClass annotation for we have existing project to migrate.
for ROO 1.0.0.RELEASE, following code will not work correct:
@Entity
@RooJavaBean
@RooToString
@RooEntity
@IdClass(AbcPK.class)
public class Abc {
	@Id
	@Column
	private String pk1;
	@Id
	@Column
	private String pk2;
	@Column
	private String name;
	@Column
	private Integer count;
}
