Reverse engineering a database table with version column name when is not a @Version
Execute a reverse engineering in a database table with a column named "version".
Generated property is annotated with @Version, when this column there is not a concurrency control column.
Entity update will modify automatically this value when could store important info.
Also application can crash if version column has no numeric type (varchar in example).
Related task ROO-3254 closed before solution patch created.
I attach a diff patch with a solution:

Create new command option "disableVersionFields"
By default work as before (false by default)
If true, don&amp;apos;t generate a "@Version" property (in Entity.aj) when "version" column name found
Generate "version" property as any other field (in DbManaged.aj and entity *.jspx)
