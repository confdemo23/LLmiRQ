Dependency should not use JavaSymbolName for artifactId
Currently, Dependency.java uses JavaSymbolName for the type of the artifactId. This is unnecessary as artifact ids are typically not class or package types like the groupId. It also prevents the dash ("-") character being added as an invalid character for class and package names.
