Metadata items are not checking to see if the existing member was created by them
In some places, such as ServiceInterfaceMetadata, ServiceClassMetadata and JpaEntityMetadata, no check to determine if the member found, when checking to see if a member already exists, was declared by the the producing metadata item. Generally if the member was declared by the producing metadata then the behaviour is different, see EntityMetadata.
