database reverse engineer doesn&apos;t create all artefacts
We have a database with 4 tables and 2 views.
Command below:






database reverse engineer --schema public --package ~.domain 




  --testAutomatically --enableViews 






creates the 1st table (alphabetic order) found.
Then, by exiting and executing Roo again, other artefacts related to the other tables.
