web gwt all doesn&apos;t create a gwt source entry
The "web gwt all" command requires 2 parameters: proxy &amp; request package locations.  If the developer chooses to put them in the top level package ie ~.proxy and ~.request the compiler will complain that it cannot find the source for these files.  Roo could add a line in ApplicationScaffold.gwt.xml &lt;source path="request"/&gt; and &lt;source path="proxy"/&gt;
