Do not allow creation of DataOnDemand class for abstract entities
Related to https://jira.springsource.org/browse/ROO-321, you can define a DataOnDemand class that is based on an abstract entity.  This should not be allowed as it won&amp;apos;t compile.
Example:






entity --class ~.model.Foo




dod --entity ~.model.Foo
