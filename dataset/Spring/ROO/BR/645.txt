Shell reports incorrect location of database.properties
If you configure a new project using Oracle, like this:






project --topLevelPackage foo




persistence setup --provider HIBERNATE --database ORACLE






... the shell will respond to the second command as follows:






Created SRC_MAIN_RESOURCES\META-INF\persistence.xml




Created SRC_MAIN_RESOURCES\META-INF\spring\database.properties




please enter your database details in src/main/resources/database.properties




Managed SRC_MAIN_RESOURCES\META-INF\spring\applicationContext.xml




Managed ROOT\pom.xml






The bug is that database.properties is actually located in src\main\resources\META-INF\spring, not src/main/resources as the third line indicates.
