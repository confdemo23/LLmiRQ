 Multiple writable mappings for fields if using database reverse engineering
I tried the database reverse engineering on a MySQL database Hyperic stores its data in. I use EclipseLink as JPA provider.
The result when I start the application is:
Exception [EclipseLink-48] (Eclipse Persistence Services - 2.1.0.v20100614-r7608): org.eclipse.persistence.exceptions.DescriptorException
Exception Description: Multiple writable mappings exist for the field [HQ.EAM_UI_ATTACH_RSRC.ATTACH_ID].  Only one may be defined as writable, all others must be specified read-only.
Mapping: org.eclipse.persistence.mappings.OneToOneMapping[eamUiAttachment]
Descriptor: RelationalDescriptor(com.springsource.dbintrospection.domain.EamUiAttachRsrc --&gt; [DatabaseTable(HQ.EAM_UI_ATTACH_RSRC)])
I attached the ITDs. It appears that it mapped to a relation to another table as well as the primary key. I am not sure how the foreign key relation was reverse engineered but I believe this database design is not so uncommon after all.
