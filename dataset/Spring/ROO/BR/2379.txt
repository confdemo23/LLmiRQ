Push-in of methods from _Roo_Entity.aj causes method to be removed from corresponding Request .java
Push-in persist method from MyEntity_Roo_Entity.aj to MyEntity.java works if you do manually edit MyEntity. However after editing the persist() in MyEntity, Roo removes the persist() from ~.client.managed.request.MyEntityRequest. This causes a compile error. Manually replacing the method in MyEntityRequest fixes this until MyEntity is edited again.
