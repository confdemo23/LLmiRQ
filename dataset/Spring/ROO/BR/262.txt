"process" commands in MavenCommands should set current working directory for spawned Maven process
The MavenCommands.mvn method does not set the working directory of  the maven process. This causes the command to fail if running embedded  
inside STS (the current directory is not the Roo project directory).  You can fix that by passing the working directory to the  "Runtime.exec" call: Runtime.getRuntime().exec("mvn clean eclipse:clean", new String[0], new File("/file/system/path/ roo-1.0.0.RC2/clinic"));
