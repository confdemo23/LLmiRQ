Spring Roo 1.0.2 DB2 trailing space in driver class name prevents its loading.
Spring Roo v1.0.2 add a trailing space to the database.properties database.driverClassName=com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver when setting DB2 as database in persistence setup preventing to load Driver class at compile time and runtime.
This issue is visible when launching maven with trace enabled (-e switch) reading the Driver class name it is looking for ("...DB2Driver ")
