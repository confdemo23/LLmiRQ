WebScaffoldMetadata copies from wrong method&apos;s builder when generating "populateXxx" methods
Found this while refactoring in preparation for ROO-2514. WebScaffoldMetadata#getPopulateMethods() contains this code:






if (javaTypePersistenceMd != null &amp;&amp; javaTypePersistenceMd.getFindAllMethod() != null) {




    bodyBuilder.appendFormalLine("return " + javaTypePersistenceMd.getFindAllMethod().getMethodCall() + ";");




    javaTypePersistenceMd.getFindMethod().copyAdditionsTo(builder, governorTypeDetails); // !!!




}






On the line marked "!!!", copyAdditionsTo is invoked on the MemberTypeAdditions of the "find" method instead of the "findAll" method. This could cause the generated "populateXxx" method not to compile if:

there was no "find" method (unlikely)
the "find" method was provided by a different layer component (service, repository, active record, etc.) to the "find all" method (more likely, but still pretty unlikely)
