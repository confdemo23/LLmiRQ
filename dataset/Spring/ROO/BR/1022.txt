package-info.java fails with &apos;The first letter of the type name portion must be uppercase&apos;
If a package definition package-info.java file is present in the project source  (src/main/java) and the &amp;apos;controller class ..&amp;apos; command is attempted then Roo fails with the following error:
"The first letter of the type name portion must be uppercase (attempted &amp;apos;&lt;mypackage&gt;.package-info&amp;apos;)"
The complete stack trace is attached (package-info-error-stacktrace.txt). Also attached is a sample project that reproduces the issue. 
This seems to be a similar issue to http://jira.springframework.org/browse/ROO-73 but happens in different execution path. 
An attempt to relax the check conditions in the JavaType.jave caused some other (ASTParesr) issues. 
So as temporal fix I have pached the org.springframework.roo.classpath.itd.AbstractItdMetadataProvider to filter out the package-info classes (line 91):
 if (!fullPath.endsWith("package-info.java"))
{
   fullPath = fullPath.substring(1, fullPath.lastIndexOf(".java")).replace(
      File.separatorChar, &amp;apos;.&amp;apos;); 
   JavaType javaType = new JavaType(fullPath);
   String mid = createLocalIdentifier(javaType, path);
   allMids.add(mid);
 }
