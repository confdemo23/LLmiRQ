Maps fields not supported by mvc plugin
Either it needs to be marked as caveat in release doc that map fields are unsupported or it is a bug.
In 1.0.0.RC1 , roo cannot decide on plural name for Map&lt;String,Entity&gt; - it tries to find a plural for first param instead of second , specifying @RooPlural on String is out of question  . Not sure how the gui should look like for a map - probably list of entries....
