gwt-setup fails if using a set of enums with "String index out of range: -1 "
Using an entity that has a Set&lt;SomeEnum&gt; causes gwt-setup to fail with an error message "String index out of range: -1" 
If gwt-setup is already run and you attempt to add a Set of enums, the command will fail with the same error message.
I attached both a log.roo and an input .roo file the should help reproduce this issue. 
If I manually add in the Set of enums, it will also fail - so I don&amp;apos;t know of a workaround for this (aside from not using a set of enums)
