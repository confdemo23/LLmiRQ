Initial tests fail after reverse engineering
I&amp;apos;ve reverse engineered a database, generated test classes for each entity (one at a time), and when I run the tests they all fail. I don&amp;apos;t think I&amp;apos;m even hitting the db before it fails.
The exceptions can be found in the Surefire-Reports directory.
