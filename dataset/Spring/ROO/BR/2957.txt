validationMessageCode is erroneously added to boolean attributes in jspx files
When a scaffold is generated for a JPA entity with a Boolean field, a validationMessageCode attribute is erroneously added to the jspx file:






 &lt;field:checkbox field="emailAllowed"




	id="c_com_kn_core_domain_KnEmailSource_emailAllowed"




	validationMessageCode="field_invalid_email"




	z="wTN+Jq4iS1yreKGSzQx31kMngEI=" /&gt;






... which generates an error when the page is loaded.
According to the TLD, the validationMessageCode attribute is invalid for the checkbox tag.
