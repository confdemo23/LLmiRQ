web mvc scaffold disallowedOperations create does not remove all create tags
When creating our mvc scaffold we include the "--disallowedOperations delete, create" option.  This successfully removed the create link from the default project page. We instead have finders in the menu.  After selecting a finder and searching our objects, a JspTagException is given as the tag&amp;apos;menu_item_xxx_new_label&amp;apos; does not exist.  We added this tag to applications.properties which then allowed us to receive a page back from the finder.  The object list does not include the delete operation, but after the object list, a create operation still exists.  I&amp;apos;m having difficulty finding exactly where this tag is built and placed in the page, but without the create operation it should not exist.
