ConversionServiceMetadata can&apos;t handle multiple backing types with the same type name but different packages
If two types exist with same type name but different packages, e.g. com.foo.bar.Test and com.bar.foo.Test, ConversionServiceMetatadata creates methods with the same name and tries to add it to the ITD builder which leads to an exception. This issue can be verified by running Roo with the BrokerSystem project.
