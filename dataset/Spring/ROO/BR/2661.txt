Metadata conventions not being adhered to
Whilst the foundation is present for invalidating a MetadataItem after instantiation it is not being used in number of places, i.e. the MetadataItem is being returned as valid when it is not, which leads to instability in Roo. 
Roo&amp;apos;s metadata system works on the principal that if a MetadataItem can&amp;apos;t be created, for whatever reason, null should be returned from MetadataProvider.get(String). When such a condition is reached within a MetadataItem a flag needs to be set and this flag should be interpreted by the provider in order to determine if the produced MetadataItem is valid and if it is not then null would be returned instead of the incomplete MetadataItem. The valid flag can already be found in AbstractMetadataItem, which most MetadataItems extend, and if the MetadataProvider extends AbstractItdMetadataProvider, then, if the produced MetadataItem is invalid null will be returned.
