Stale sha info in Roo shell in STS
Set up STS 2.5.0.M3 Build Id: 201008251000 to use a roo built from source
Make or import a roo project and note the sha it shows when the shell starts
Close the shell
Commit a change to git and rebuild roo
rm -rf spring-roo/bootstrap/target/osgi
run roo-dev somewhere
Now open a roo shell again. Note that that it&amp;apos;s still reporting the old sha. But it&amp;apos;s pretty clear that it&amp;apos;s actually running the new bits that you built. Looks like the code that displays that sha is pulling it from some stale cached location. 
A minor bug, perhaps, but it just sent me on a bit of a wild goose chase.
