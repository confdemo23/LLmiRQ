ROO generate GWT code that is GAE dependent even if not building for GAE
After having setup the presistency and database, i created some basic entity
Then I executed "gwt setup".
After quite some time the scaffold project was created.
It created a ~.server.gae package that failed to compile.
This package contains the classes:
GaeAuthFilter.java, UserSServiceLocator.java and UserServiceWrapper.java
This package does not compile because the gae references could not be resolved:
import com.google.appengine.api.users.UserService;
import com.google.appengine.api.users.UserServiceFactory;
So it seems that:
1) gae classes are being created.
2) gae classes cannot be compiled dependencies are not set.
I can although execute the application (from console: mvn gwt:run)
which runs as expected.
