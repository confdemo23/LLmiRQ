JavaParserUtils incorrectly identifies methods returning "void" as being JavaType Void objects instead of JavaType void primitives
Declaring a method in a .java file with a "void" return type will be incorrectly represented by JavaParserUtils. The method should be reported as a JavaType.VOID_PRIMITIVE.
