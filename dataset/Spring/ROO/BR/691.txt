custom controller paths not supported in 1.1.0.M1 (#674)
While checking in on your ongoing UI improvements, I built a development build of Roo and discovered that custom controller paths with nested directories (e.g., "--path secure/vote") no longer work. Trying to use one results in the following error:

Illegal name &amp;apos;secured/vote&amp;apos; (illegal character)
Script execution aborted
Here&amp;apos;s a script you can use to replicate:






project --topLevelPackage com.springsource.vote









persistence setup --provider HIBERNATE --database HYPERSONIC_PERSISTENT









logging setup --level DEBUG --package WEB









entity --class Vote




field string ip --notNull --sizeMin 7 --sizeMax 15




controller scaffold ~.web.VoteController --path secured/vote









security setup
