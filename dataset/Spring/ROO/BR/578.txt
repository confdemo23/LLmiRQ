Incorrect help text for "finder add" command when invalid finder name entered
For any entity, enter this command:






finder add --finderName f






Roo will respond with:






required --finderName: The finder string as generated with &amp;apos;list finders for&amp;apos;; no default value






The problem is that there is no "list finders for" command; it&amp;apos;s actually the "finder list" command.
