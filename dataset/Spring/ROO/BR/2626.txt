SEVERE: Servlet.service() for servlet jsp threw exception
org.springframework.core.convert.ConverterNotFoundException: No converter found capable of converting from &amp;apos;java.util.Set&amp;apos; to &amp;apos;java.lang.String&amp;apos;

This issues is related to Roo issue 2409.
I have attached the Roo project as well as the SQL DDL used to generate the SQL Server 2008 database. The database schema used by the web application contains 4 tables. The tables SECTOR and INDUSTRY each contains one single record and the rest of the tables are empty.
The Web application works perfectly as long as I only build a web aplication based on these 3 tables: SECTOR, INDUSTRY and COMPANY. 
Once I add the COMPANY_COMPETITOR table to the database schema and then regneerates the entire Roo project from scratch the execption above occurs. Note that the table COMPANY_COMPETITOR has 2 individual foreign key constraints that each reference the same column in the COMPANY table.
Best regards
