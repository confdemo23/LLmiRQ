Overriding method results in Method &apos;*&apos; already defined in target type
I had a working project running 1.1.2. I upgraded to 1.1.3 and the following issues began. I have not found a work-around but wonder if there is a technique for overriding methods that I should be using and am not.
In my AthleteController I have the following:
Code:
@RequestMapping(value = "/
{id}
", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public String show(@PathVariable("id") Long id, Model uiModel) 
{
	AthleteController.addBirthdayDateTimeFormatPatterns(uiModel);
	uiModel.addAttribute("athlete", Athlete.findAthlete(id));
	uiModel.addAttribute("itemId", id);
	return "athletes/show";
    }

and in my roo shell it instantly complains:
Code:
Method &amp;apos;show&amp;apos; already defined in target type &amp;apos;com.blah.controllers.AthleteController&amp;apos; (ITD target &amp;apos;com.blah.controllers.AthleteController_Roo_Controller&amp;apos;)
For basically every method that I have overridden in my controllers it complains. (As I fix one, the next one comes up complaining in the shell.) Renaming the method name does stop the complaining,but Roo then also re-gen&amp;apos;s the method in the Roo class.
