Missing toString() call in Controller, when registering converter of one field entities
When an entity is defined with only one field (besides "id" and "version" generated fields), and a controller is generated for that entity, the method registerConverters defines an anonymous class Converter&lt;Entity, String&gt; which tries to convert the entity type to String calling "public String convert(Entity entity)". If the entity has only one field, the toString() method of that field is not called as following:
public String convert(Entity entity) {
  return Entity.getField();
}
resulting on a compiler error:
[ERROR] Type mismatch: cannot convert from FieldType to String
Possible fix: call the toString() method only when there is one field within the entity, or call the toString() method no matter what
