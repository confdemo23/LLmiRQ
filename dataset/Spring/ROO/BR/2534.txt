The default @DateTimeFormat with  "S-" has MM/dd/yy pattern leading to a bug like Y2K
as stated from java docs the "S-" patter corresponds to something like MM/dd/yy for I think all locales.
this combined with the generated widget constructed with the same pattern lead to a Y2K like bug.
inserting 01/01/1911 will be displayed correctly on the widget but posted as 01/01/11 and translated as 01/01/2011 on the server.
