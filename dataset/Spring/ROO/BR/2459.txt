GWT Addon does not support multiple modules
If a project has more than one GWT module file (i.e. ApplicationScaffold.gwt.xml and HelloWorld.gwt.xml), Roo fails to parse any of them.  Any entities created afterwards are ignored by the GWT Addon.  In Roo 1.1.4.RELEASE, the shell gives the message ...
"GWT module&amp;apos;s gwt.xml file not found; cannot continue"
In 1.1.4.SNAPSHOT, the shell currently fails to give any failure message.
This is unacceptable for many typical uses of Roo.  For instance, during development I create my own GWT Module for my application, but leave the ApplicationScaffold module around to help out with debugging during development.  I never deploy it to production, but it is certainly nice to have around!
