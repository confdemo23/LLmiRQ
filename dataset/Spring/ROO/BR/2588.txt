TypeLocationService does not detect types with annotations in project due to eager caching
TypeLocationService.processTypesWithAnnotation() uses caching based on !fileMonitorService.isDirty(); (line 140 &amp; 162). This leads to skipping of newly written types with the given annotation. I think this is because the file monitor service scans the file system once every 1000ms and if a Roo service invokes MemberFindingUtils.getAnnotationOfType(..) within that timespan it will not see the type because the fileMonitorService is not marked as dirty yet. Assigning to Alan to verify.
