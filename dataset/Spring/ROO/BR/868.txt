GWT support broken
As already pointed out in #ROO-865 the expense demo does not work. Digging deeper it seems that the GWT support is broken. I created two demos. The first has a simple domain object and shows the behavior described in #ROO-865. The second has no domain object and doesn&amp;apos;t work but with a different error.
