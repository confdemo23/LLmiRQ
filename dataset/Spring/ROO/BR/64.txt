Annotations containing class attributes erroneously remain unqualified
As detailed in ROO-50, creating an integration test for an entity named com.foo.Test will erroneously result in the following type declaration:
package com.foo;
import org.springframework.roo.addon.test.RooIntegrationTest;
import org.junit.Test;
@RooIntegrationTest(entity = Test.class)
public class TestIntegrationTest 
{ ... }

The annotation should be @RooIntegrationTest(entity = com.foo.Test.class), not @RooIntegrationTest(entity = Test.class). It is unclear at this moment whether this is due to a bug in the Java Parser metadata component or specific to the integration test add-on.
