Setting findAllMethod="" in an Entity removes POST methods in Controller
My requirement is that I want to limit users to dealing with a searched for entity by rather than given them access to a list of all elements.
I thought the easiest way to achieve this was to set findAllMethod="" within the entity, so I had the following within my @RooEntity annotation:
@RooEntity( findAllMethod="" )
 Unfortunately when I did so, I discovered that the controller was modified to remove all POST related methods which is not desirable.
