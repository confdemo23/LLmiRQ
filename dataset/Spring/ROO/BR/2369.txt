A certain field variable breaks ROO. It only writes "Index: 0, Size: 0" into the console and does not do anything anymore.
Please see the attached extremely simple ROO project, which reproduces the problem. I created it with ROO and also created a tst directory and a test java file in its src/main/java directory.
What happens is that ROO stops working. It says "Index: 0, Size: 0" in the ROO console (started from the command line to be sure...) and does not create any .aj files any more.
(I did not see that problem with 1.1.2.RELEASE.)
Thanks for having a look at it!
