MemberFindingUtils getDeclaredConstructor and getDeclaredMethod fail to return correct methods
MemberFindingUtils.getDeclaredMethod and MemberFindingUtils.getDeclaredConstructor are failing to locate valid methods which are of the requested parameter types. 
For example, a Choice.java class containing "public void setId(Long id)" is unable to be located with a call to MemberFindingUtils.getDeclaredMethod(...). This is due to an erroneous comparison between AnnotatedJavaType and JavaType, as JavaType instances are presented to the method but the internal comparison expects a collection of AnnotatedJavaType instances instead.
The solution is to convert the method/constructor parameters from AnnotatedJavaType to JavaType instances before the comparison.
