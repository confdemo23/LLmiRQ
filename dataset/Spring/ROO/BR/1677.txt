Date handling in MVC broken
If I enter a date using the standard Roo view everything looks fine (see BeforeSubmit.png). Then I submit the value and get an error (see AfterSubmit.png). If I enter the same String without using the widget it works.
This is on Ubuntu with the browser integrated in Eclipse. Using Google Chrome  on Linux leads to different behavior (see BeforeSubmitChrome / AfterSubmitChrome). As you can see the format used there is 11.2.2010 which is a typical German layout for a Date. I am running on a German localization with the browser - maybe that is the reason for the issue.
