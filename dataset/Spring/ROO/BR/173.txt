Add ability to define field uniqueness constraints
I think it would be a useful feature for Roo to provide a way to define a field, or set of fields, as unique. For example, when adding a new field to a class:
add field string -fieldName myField -unique ....
That would then create a database column with a uniqueness constraint? Otherwise I will have to go in and manually add this constraint to all the columns that need it in the db.
Also, it would be nice to be able to define multiple-column uniqueness constraints such as in MySql:
UNIQUE KEY &amp;apos;userId_2&amp;apos; (&amp;apos;userId&amp;apos;,&amp;apos;customerId&amp;apos;)
