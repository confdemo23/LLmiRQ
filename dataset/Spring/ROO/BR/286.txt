Title pane widget creates conflict with "title" object property
For example, if I have an object with a "title" property (say, employee.title or book.title), roo generates pages with conflicting id attributes on html elements. In my own case, I had a create.jspx page that created the following jsp code:
Line 3:    &lt;div id="_title" style="width: 100%"&gt;
Line 34:                 &lt;form:textarea cssStyle="width:250px" id="_title" path="title"/&gt;
Line 37:                 &lt;form:errors cssClass="errors" id="_title" path="title"/&gt;
I&amp;apos;m not sure about the last one, which may not create an html element in the generated html, but the first two create html elements both with id="_title". (As a result, due to js errors, that page doesn&amp;apos;t even display.) 
Perhaps Roo ought to use more complex naming on its non-user-specified elements such as the title pane widget&amp;apos;s div.
