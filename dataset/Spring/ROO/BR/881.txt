scaffold method generation fails if @embedded fields are present
Generating web controller scaffolds for an entity that has an @Embedded field causes the code generation to fail with the message "Method ... failed to provide a body, despite being identified for ITD inclusion"
The method that fails to be created is the populateXXX method, where XXX is the embedded field. The current code just returns an empty method body, which later fails an assertion.
As it is not generally possible to find reasonable instances to populate the controller, an empty list should be returned in this case.
