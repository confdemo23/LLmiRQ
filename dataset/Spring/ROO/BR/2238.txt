Code completion for packages broken
In the Roo shell, code completions for packages / classes seems to be broken.
Lets assume, we have entitie in a subpackage domain.
When entering something like  controller scaffold --class ~.  , the code completion offers nothing. One has to enter "domain" by hand, and only gets code completion for the class name then.
