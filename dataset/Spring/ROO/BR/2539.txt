DataOnDemand attempts to create identifier class by creating non-existent mutator methods instead of using parmeterized constructor
It appears the composite key support offered in DoD does not correctly create the identifier class instance. The identifier class does not (and should not) provide public mutators for its fields however DoD is creating code that calls these (non-existent) methods. It should call the constructor instead.
