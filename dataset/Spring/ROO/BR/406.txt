Little bug with message.properties with scaffold
If a have a entity B that has a @manyToOne to entity A and generate a scaffold to B and A and after that I change the plural of A, roo doens&amp;apos;t update all jsp references. So, to resolve this bug I need to have 2 entries in my message.properties:

"label.old_name_of_A= ..." and "label.new_name_of_A=..."

I know, it is a very small bug.
