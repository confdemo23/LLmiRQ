Package declaration using package-info.java causes error message
If a package contains the package definition file package-info.java, the Roo shell produces the following error message:
&gt; The first letter of the type name portion must be uppercase (attempted &amp;apos;&lt;packagename&gt;.package-info&amp;apos;)
This seems to be a cosmetic issue only because Roo parses and generates code for all other files in the package as expected.
