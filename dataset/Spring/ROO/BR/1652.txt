Roo DBRE : Repeated column in mapping for entity
In an effort to obtain access to key values of foreign keys,
Ttable.java defines @Column(name = "first_bee")
Roo notices, and creates relevant _JavaBean.aj ITD, 
but fails to annotate for: (should be mapped with insert="false" update="false")
Attached is the backup.zip with mysql dump, log.roo, tc.log (the stacktrace from tc-server)
and the whole eclipse project.
