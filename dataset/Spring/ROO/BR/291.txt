the "Show Object" icon in the generated list view does not use the custom controller path
As mikej stated in the above forum post, he noticed that the "Show Object" icon in the generated list view does not use the custom controller path. 
E.g., he creates a controller with:






controller scaffold --name ~.web.home.TaskController --entity ~.domain.Task --path appuser/task






And then he navigates to /myapp/appuser/task. In the list of tasks the "show task" icon for each task row is mapped to the wrong url, e.g.:






&lt;form id="command" action="/myapp/task/23" method="GET"&gt;






Note that the "action" in this case should be "/myapp/appuser/task/23".
