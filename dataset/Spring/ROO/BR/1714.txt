Pagination doesn&apos;t reset
1. generate clinic application and run
2. create 2 owners
3. create 9 pets
4. go to "List all Pets" page
5. change results per page to 5 and go to the second page result.
6. click "List all Owners" in the menu --&gt; no owners found because page number is 2.
I guess, there must be reset of page number to 1 before entities fetching in this case.






if (page &gt; maxPages) page = 1;






Thanks
