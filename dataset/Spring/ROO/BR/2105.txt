Roo shell ignores entities in non-lower-case packages
If you manually create a Roo-annotated entity (e.g. via an IDE or text editor as opposed to using the Roo shell&amp;apos;s "entity" command) in a package containing upper-case characters, then the Roo shell quietly ignores that class. For example, no ITDs are created.
I don&amp;apos;t know if this is intended behaviour or a bug, but it would be helpful if the Roo shell could at least output a warning such as "Ignoring entity com.example.fooBar.Employee; package name is not lower case". It would be better still if Roo didn&amp;apos;t care about the casing of the package name, especially when Roo-ifying a large legacy project that has a large number of mixed case package names.
