Existing ITDs not always deleted when metadata providers return null
One instance of this bug is as follows:

Create a project like so:






project --topLevelPackage com.foo




persistence setup --provider HIBERNATE --database HYPERSONIC_IN_MEMORY




entity --class ~.Foo --testAutomatically




field string --fieldName name






The following files should (correctly) exist in src/test/java/com/foo:
	
FooDataOnDemand.java
FooDataOnDemand_Roo_DataOnDemand.aj (the ITD)


Modify the Foo entity&amp;apos;s @RooEntity annotation with findEntriesMethod=""; Roo should delete the above ITD (because it will no longer compile), however it does not.

The workaround is to delete the ITD manually.
