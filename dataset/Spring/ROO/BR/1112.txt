Web scaffold: bad handling of self-referencing parent-child entity relationships
When I create an entity with a parent-child relationship that references back to the same entity type, the generated web scaffold will not allow me to edit the relationship.
Steps to reproduce:
Execute the following code in Roo:-
project --topLevelPackage com.example.test 
persistence setup --provider HIBERNATE --database HYPERSONIC_IN_MEMORY
entity --class ~.entities.Node
field string name --sizeMax 30 --notNull
field reference --fieldName parent --type ~.entities.Node --cardinality ONE_TO_ONE
field set --fieldName children --element ~.entities.Node --cardinality ONE_TO_MANY --mappedBy parent
controller all --package ~.web
[end Roo code]
Next start up Tomcat with: mvn tomcat:run
Point a browser at http://localhost:8080/test 
Create a new &amp;apos;Node&amp;apos;. Now, go to create a second &amp;apos;Node&amp;apos; - in the form it shows:-
Parent: [create-new button] No Parent found.
Children:This relationship is managed from the Node side.
Which isn&amp;apos;t correct.
Expected behaviour:
On creating the second entity, there should either be (a) a drop-down list for choosing a &amp;apos;Parent&amp;apos;, where any pre-existing entities should appear / be selectable (as you get when you have a one-to-one relationship between differing entity types)  or (b) there should be a multi-select list for choosing &amp;apos;Children&amp;apos; (as you get when you have a one-to-many relationship between differing entity types).
I think perhaps option (a) - allowing selection of a parent - is the correct/easiest thing to do in this situation.
