Roo should facilitate creation of Repository interface and classes as per DDD concepts for domain objects and all the finder methods should be visible as part of that Repository interface. E.g. If product is a domain object created with Roo, then there should be another interface and its implementation created with name IProductRepository and ProductRepositoryImpl etc. This would make Roo in compliance to basic DDD concepts. Also, Roo should introduce Annotations for AggregateRoot, Entity etc. to be used more effectively for DDD based development
