GWT managed code: Use ProxyForName and ServiceName annotations instead of ProxyFor
Domain classes should be in the server part, and it is not necessary to share them with gwt.
If you use ProxyForName and ServiceName annotations, you could remove these classes from the shared folder and put them in the server side. 
This change allows us to customize Entity.java files with whatever we need in the server side. 
Right now, it isn&amp;apos;t possible this customization unless introducing aspect files, and it is not possible to remove completely the roo dependencies using the eclipse &amp;apos;Refactor -&gt; Push In&amp;apos; ajdt feature.
