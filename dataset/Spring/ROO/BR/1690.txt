DBRE overrides renamed Classes
I started a new Spring Roo project in STS on the specified environment.  I ran the following roo shell commands:
roo&gt; persistence setup --provider HIBERNATE --database MYSQL --hostName localhost --databaseName foodb --userName uname --password pwd
roo&gt; database reverse engineer --package foo.model --schema foodb
This generated the entities from an existing database with dbre.  One of my entities was named "Customers" because I have a "customers" table.  In the IDE, I renamed the class "Customer".  The IDE changed the class name from Customers.java to Customer.java for me.  The roo shell responded with:
Created SRC_MAIN_JAVA/foo/model/Customer_Roo_Entity.aj
Created SRC_MAIN_JAVA/foo/model/Customer_Roo_Configurable.aj
Created SRC_MAIN_JAVA/foo/model/Customer_Roo_ToString.aj
Deleted SRC_MAIN_JAVA/foo/model/Customers_Roo_ToString.aj
Deleted SRC_MAIN_JAVA/foo/model/Customers_Roo_Entity.aj
Deleted SRC_MAIN_JAVA/foo/model/Customers_Roo_DbManaged.aj
Deleted SRC_MAIN_JAVA/foo/model/Customers_Roo_Configurable.aj
Note: no Customer_Roo_DbManaged.aj was created, which seemed odd.
I next closed the roo shell and reopened it.  roo responded with:
Created /home/poneil/projects/workspace/foo/src/main/java/foo/model/Customers.java
Deleted /home/poneil/projects/workspace/foo/src/main/java/foo/model/Customer.java
Created /home/poneil/projects/workspace/foo/src/main/java/foo/model/Customers_Roo_Entity.aj
Created SRC_MAIN_JAVA/foo/model/Customers_Roo_Configurable.aj
Created SRC_MAIN_JAVA/foo/model/Customers_Roo_DbManaged.aj
Created SRC_MAIN_JAVA/foo/model/Customers_Roo_ToString.aj
Deleted SRC_MAIN_JAVA/foo/model/Customer_Roo_Configurable.aj
Deleted SRC_MAIN_JAVA/foo/model/Customer_Roo_ToString.aj
Deleted SRC_MAIN_JAVA/foo/model/Customer_Roo_Entity.aj
this essentially completely reverses the renaming of the entity, and is the problem that I wish to report.  I should be able to rename/tweak an entity after DBRE.
