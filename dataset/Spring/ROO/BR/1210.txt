Import statements missing package name.
I have a class SignCommand annotated with @RooJavaBean and with this property:
somepackage.SomeClass.Enum sslRef;
For this roo generates this getter:
    public Enum SignCommand.getSslRef() 
{
        return this.sslRef;
    }

which is fine, but it imports SomeClass.Enum without package name, so the import can&amp;apos;t be resolved.
