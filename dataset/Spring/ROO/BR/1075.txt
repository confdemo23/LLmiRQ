DataOnDemand does not respect the optional=false attribute of @ManyToOne
When specifying a ManyToOne annotation, the optional = false attribute implies a NOT NULL column. However, the DataOnDemand aspect will not populate the field, or provide the link to the related DataOnDemand bean unless @NotNull is explicitly included.
Proposed fix: Have @ManyToOne(optional = false) cause the same behaviour as @NotNull
