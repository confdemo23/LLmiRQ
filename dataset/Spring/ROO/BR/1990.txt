Dependency should not use JavaPackage for groupId
The groupId field of the Dependency class uses JavaPackage for its type. Maven groupIds can be specified such that they are not valid Java package names. For example commons-logging is a valid groupId but is not a valid Java package name as it contains a dash. This prevents the dash character to be added to the list of illegal characters in the check for valid package names in JavaSymbolName. This change will make groupId a String with some checks to ensure the XML remains well-formed and also add the dash character to JavaPackage as it should.
