Provide a mechanism to have a class implement an interface via the roo shell.  &apos;inheritance&apos; command
Can be run on the current entity/class
inheritance --extends ~.ParentClass
Extends the current class
inheritance --implements ~.MyInterface
Implements an interface to the current class.  Stubs all non-implemented methods. Maybe adds @RooStub annotation to top of class?
Also add --implements to &amp;apos;entity&amp;apos; command.
Obviously there is great value in this, but my specific use case would be to create service methods for addons without providing the entity implementations.  
For instance, let&amp;apos;s say I wanted to create an add-on that has a UserService
userService.doSomething(User user) {
   // changes user object
   // calls user.persist();
}
takes interface User 
I don&amp;apos;t want to provide an entity here because I don&amp;apos;t want to couple to a persistence type.  So instead I expect the user to install the UserService addon and then create a MyUser object that implements the User interface.
entity --class ~.MyUser --implements User
