Unable to obtain required element &apos;name&apos; from element &apos;[repository: null]&apos;
I added a repository in my pom that did not include a "name" element:






&lt;repository&gt;




    &lt;id&gt;spring-json&lt;/id&gt;




    &lt;url&gt;http://spring-json.sourceforge.net/repository&lt;/url&gt;




&lt;/repository&gt;






I started Roo and got the following error:

Unable to obtain required element &amp;apos;name&amp;apos; from element &amp;apos;[repository: null]&amp;apos;
I can add a name element to my repository definition, no problem. Just wanted to log this issue as the error message is not very particular and the condition of not having a name element in a repository definition should maybe not result in an error.
Seems to affect 1.1, but not 1.0.2.
