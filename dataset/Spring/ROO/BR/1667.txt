Quoted single arguments in Roo shell do not terminate the current argument buffer unless a space is added at the end of argument
When surrounding an argument with double quotes, currently a space must be added to the end of the argument before the second double quote else the same option is displayed again when TAB is pressed.
For example:
entity --class "Foo" then TAB causes --class to be displayed again. 
Multiple valued arguments are not affected. For example, the hypothetical command below works OK:
echo --message "foo bar" then TAB does not cause --message to be displayed again.
Also, echo --message "foo" then ENTER prompts for the --message again
