Integration tests fail when column is unique and field length is greater than column length
When a field, for example, is called "registration"  size restriction and unique constraints are placed on field, as like here:






    @NotNull




    @Column(unique = true)




    @Size(min = 8, max = 8)




    private String registration;






unit tests will fail as the field initializer is truncated, but is not unique in all cases
