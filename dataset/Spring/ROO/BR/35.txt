Roo does not create code for classes with abstract methods
If a class contains an abstract method, Roo fails to create the AJ files for its annotations. If any files are existing already, then they will be deleted.
Example:
@RooToString
@RooJavaBean
public abstract class Foo 
{

  private String foo;

}

this creates the AJ files for the getters/setters + the toString method. If you add the method
public abstract void bar();
then Roo deletes the AJ files. If, however, the abstract method has a body, Roo creates AJ files as expected:
public abstract void bar() {
}
works.
