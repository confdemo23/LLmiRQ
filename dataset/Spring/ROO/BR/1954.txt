update.jspx does not get updated when a version field is removed from the scaffolded form backing object
To reproduce run clinic.roo (leave shell running) and remove the versionField from Visit.java (in a separate shell) - notice that update.jspx is not modified as it should. As a workaround this can be fixed by restarting the Roo shell on the project.
