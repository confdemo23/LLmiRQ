perform shows no output in STS
Looks a bit like ROO-392, but for the current downloadable version.
I did more or less what the introduction told me to.
When I execute perform tests I get:

Maybe this is an issue with my setup, here is what I did:
Download STS
Start STS
Go through tutorial
perform tests ==&gt; mvn.bat not found.
Downloaded maven, add maven to PATH
perform tests
Restart STS
perform tests
No luck..
