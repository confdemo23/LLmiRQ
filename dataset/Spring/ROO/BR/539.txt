Console does not produce output on jdk 1.6.0_18
Console does not produce output when running on Sun JDK 1.6.0_18.
I had to re-install Sun JDK 1.6.0_17 in order to get it working.
Note that a similar problem was reported in http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?t=80983 , except I was using Sun JDK.
