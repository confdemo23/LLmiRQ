getter method without corresponding field causes GwtMetadata.buildProxy to throw a NullPointerException
Changes in commit 5b3c43c241e006f06596e5f8ba38ae9eb66002ae cause the Gwt addon to produce a NPE if there is a getter method but no corresponding field in a bean.
In commit 45dfd34f0753c6e95129083f0cd5b14bbb5e73a9 this happens in line 238 of GwtMetadata. I&amp;apos;ve attached a simple patch that uses the accessor method&amp;apos;s return type in case there&amp;apos;s no corresponding field. I don&amp;apos;t understand why it was changed in the first place though.
