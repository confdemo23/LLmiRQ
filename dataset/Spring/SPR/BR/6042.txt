AnnotationSessionFactoryBean packagesToScan in a OSGi environment
The code






String pattern = ResourcePatternResolver.CLASSPATH_ALL_URL_PREFIX +




    ClassUtils.convertClassNameToResourcePath(pkg) + RESOURCE_PATTERN;






in the AnnotationSessionFactoryBean.scanPackages() method resolves the pattern to scan to classpath:com/mycompany*/.class* for a packagesToScan="com/mycompany", but it fails to get the resources. I think a slash is missing to obtain classpath:com/mycompany/*/.class*, like the one in ClassPathScanningCandidateComponentProvider.findCandidateComponents():






String packageSearchPath = ResourcePatternResolver.CLASSPATH_ALL_URL_PREFIX +




    resolveBasePackage(basePackage) + "/" + this.resourcePattern;






or at least a setResourcePattern() like ClassPathScanningCandidateComponentProvider.
