Provide support for Http Client 4 now that it is available
The Commons Http Client project has been promoted to a top-level project called "Http Components" and released a major new version at http://hc.apache.org.  It is now recommended that those using Http Client 3.x upgrade to version 4.x.  It would be great to see support for Http Client 4.x in Spring Framework for use with RestTemplate.
As a side note, we&amp;apos;ve also noticed some resourcing issues with Http Client 3.1 reported by tc Server on app shutdown:






11-Oct-2010 19:20:21.156 SEVERE org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader.clearReferencesThreads The web application [] appears to have started a thread named [MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager cleanup] but has failed to stop it. This is very likely to create a memory leak.






When I was troubleshooting this leak I noticed the Http Client library has had a major upgrade.
