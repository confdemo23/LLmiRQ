@MVC URI Template Variable Regression - Matching values containing . (dot)
Given the URI Template:
http://www.example.com/users/
{username}
/blah.html
In M1 - M3 and RC1 the username could be "bill" or "bill.smith" and everything would work.
Starting with RC3 (I never got around to using RC2) "bill" still works fine, but "bill.smith" causes a HTTP 404 to be returned due to:
DispatcherServlet.noHandlerFound(962) | No mapping found for HTTP request with URI
