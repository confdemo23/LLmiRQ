Provide TestContext support for @Configuration classes
Currently, JavaConfig integrates with the TestContext framework via its ContextLoader implementation, JavaConfigContextLoader:






@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)




@ContextConfiguration(locations="com.bank.TransferAppConfig",




                      loader=JavaConfigContextLoader.class)




public class TransferServiceTests {




    // @Test methods ...




}






This integration works well enough but is not refactoring-friendly due to the requirement that @ContextConfiguration imposes that locations must be a String[]. It forces the fully-qualified class name to be expressed as a string, when it would clearly be superior to be able to pass it around by Class literal.
Implementing this change would require a change to core, either by adding an attribute to @ContextConfiguration that takes a Class[] (not likely), or otherwise devising a way of proving a customized annotation (e.g., @JavaConfigContextConfiguration).
