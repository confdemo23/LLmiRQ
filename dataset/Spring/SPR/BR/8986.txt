Add the ability to Scan Packages for JAXB Marshalling (java example provided)
Hi,
In our application we have a rapidly growing number of JAXB2 annotated classes. It is a right pain to add these classes manually to the "classesToBeBound" property in the Jaxb2Marshaller. Given that other components (I&amp;apos;m looking at you Hibernate : AnnotationSessionFactoryBean) have the ability to automatically add classes from packages that match annotations, why not then for the Jaxb2Marshaller (having to key in the classes manually is so old skool).
I&amp;apos;ve extended Jaxb2Marshaller (file attached) that scans on the classpath for appropriately annotated classes. Please do review and I hope that this can be incorporated into the next release. I&amp;apos;m happy to make changes to the codebase if required to bring it up to Spring coding standards.
It&amp;apos;s a pity that afterPropertiesSet is marked as Final in Jaxb2Marshaller since I can&amp;apos;t override that method to set up the setClassesToBeBound before then calling the super afterPropertiesSet. Currently as the code stands, I have to provide a dummy setClassesToBeBound and setLazyInit to be true. This dummy is then replaced by overriding the getJaxbContext. I think this needs rewriting.
An example of use:






&lt;bean id="marshaller" class="foo.bar.AnnotationJaxb2Marshaller"&gt;




    &lt;property name="lazyInit" value="true" /&gt;




    &lt;property name="classesToBeBound"&gt;




       &lt;list&gt;




           &lt;value&gt;foo.bar.Class&lt;/value&gt;




       &lt;/list&gt;




    &lt;/property&gt;




    &lt;property name="packagesToScan"&gt;




        &lt;list&gt;




            &lt;value&gt;foo.bar.jaxb.model&lt;/value&gt;




        &lt;/list&gt;




    &lt;/property&gt;




&lt;/bean&gt;
