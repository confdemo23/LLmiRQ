Missing @Configuration annotation will cause transaction not working
The Spring reference didn&amp;apos;t mention that I MUST use @Configuration for the configuration class being imported. And I found that the bean could be created normally most of the time.
The case I found that if @Configuration is missing, transaction is not behave normally in some cases.
I have setup a simple program to illustrate this. Please refer to "readme.txt" for the running procedures. From the log, I have checked that the transaction commit command has been issued, but the end result is the value is not committed.
In the example, I have already used SingleConnectionDataSource, to avoid multiple database connection issue.
I have also tried to move the @EnableTransactionManagement and transactionManager() to other Spring Java Config class (no matter with/without @Configuration), but the problem still occurs.
