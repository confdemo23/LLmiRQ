@ActiveProfiles not taken into account for @ImportResource-imported XML context definitions from an @Configuration context definition
When using @ActiveProfiles to activate certain profiles in a test that uses AnnotationConfigContextLoader to load a @Configuration context definition which imports XML application context definitions using @ImportResource, the active profiles are not considered when loading the XML context definition.
See the attached files for a test reproducing the problem. This test fails with the following error:
org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No matching bean of type [test.ContextLoadingProblem$Bar] found for dependency: expected at least 1 bean which qualifies as autowire candidate for this dependency. Dependency annotations: 
{@org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired(required=true)}

Note that if you use XML throughout (i.e. import one XML context definition from another), the problem does not arise.
