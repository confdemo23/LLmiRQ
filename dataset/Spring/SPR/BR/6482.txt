@RequestMapping handled incorrectly when value contains "." (dot) character
At the moment in my code exist method with such signature:






@RequestMapping(value = "/projects/{filter}/{order}-{direction}", method = RequestMethod.GET)




public String filteredProjectListing(@PathVariable("filter") String filter, @PathVariable("order") String order,




            @PathVariable("direction") String direction, ModelMap model) {




 ...




}






order is String variable containing ognl-like expresssion ie. "raging.result" (which I later use for BeanComparator) but this mapping is in version RC3 is not found, which is different behaviour from RC2 where there is no such problem.
Log message with example of given fault result is:






2009-12-01 16:38:02,459 WARN [org.springframework.web.servlet.PageNotFound] - &lt;No mapping found for HTTP request with URI [/Example/projects/all/rate.result-asc.html] in DispatcherServlet with name &amp;apos;Example&amp;apos;&gt;






There is no problem with handling path which doesn&amp;apos;t contain more &amp;apos;.&amp;apos; (dot) characters, so this can probably help you with analysis of the problem.
