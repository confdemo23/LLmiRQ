PathVariable mappings are greedy over hard coded mappings
Hard coded request mapping values should take precedence over path variables.  Wild card patterns in a path are currently inferior to explicit values.  Path variables should be applied after explicit paths and before wild cards.
For example:
@RequestMapping(value = "/resources/new/", method = RequestMethod.GET)
is currently trumped by
@RequestMapping(value = "/resources/
{resourceName}/", method = RequestMethod.GET)

@RequestMapping(value = "/resources/new/", method = RequestMethod.GET)
currently trumps
@RequestMapping(value = "/resources/*/", method = RequestMethod.GET)


@RequestMapping(value = "/resources/new/", method = RequestMethod.GET)
should trump
@RequestMapping(value = "/resources/{resourceName}
/", method = RequestMethod.GET)
should trump
@RequestMapping(value = "/resources/*/", method = RequestMethod.GET)
