RC2: Issue with RequestMethod.GET differs from M2
I have a demo for Spring 3 Web that I&amp;apos;ve been running for some time... the upgrade to RC2 broke the demo.  The code is listed below.  What we need is details on the order of requestmappings... I thought I saw that earlier this year in the forums, but I can&amp;apos;t find it anymore.  Can someone please provide the details on the order of requestmappings... thanks.
The code below (which worked before) now fails for a GET request against the list method or http://localhost:8080/mvc/book/list
I had specified the GET and POST for clarification before on the create methods... after some investigation, I discovered that if I remove the method = RequestMethod.GET on the create method that the app begins to work.  So I can work around this.  What behavior should be expected?






@Controller




public class BookController {









    @Autowired




    BookDAO dao;









    // http://localhost:8080/mvc/book/list




    @RequestMapping("list")




    public List&lt;Book&gt; list() {




        return dao.findAllBooks();




    }









    // http://localhost:8080/mvc/book/book?id=12




    @RequestMapping("book")




    public Book book(@RequestParam(required = true) Long id) {









        Book book = dao.getBook(id);




        return book;




    }









    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)




    public Book create() {




        return new Book();









    }









    // http://localhost:8080/mvc/book/create (POST)




    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST)




    public String create(@ModelAttribute Book book, BindingResult results) {









        if (book == null)




            return null;









        dao.save(book);









        return "redirect:list";




    }




}
