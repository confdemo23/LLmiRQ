Collection Binding broken - TypeConverterDelegate does bind Collection Elements to Collection type instead of the collection elements Type
Please look at the attached Testcase. Conversion does work for String -&gt; Set in 3.0.5 but fails in 3.0.6. Elements are converted to the collection type rather than their Collections elements type.
The revision and bug which causes this is mentioned in the forum thread.
