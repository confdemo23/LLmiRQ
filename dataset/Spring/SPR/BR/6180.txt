Upgrade Apache HttpClient to version 4.0
Folks,
Please consider upgrading HttpClient to version 4.0 which is the latest stable (GA) version of the library. Commons HttpClient 3.1 is very likely to be deprecated / officially declared end of life very soon (3 - 6 months). There have been no bug fixes in the 3.x branch for over a year. 
Patch attached. Unfortunately I was unable to fix the Ivy build which I am not very familiar with.
