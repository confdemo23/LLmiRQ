ServletRequestDataBinder does not bind MultipartFile with HiddenHttpMethodFilter and Multipart Request
I have setup a MultipartFilter and HtmlHiddenMethodFilter following the instructions in SPR-6594 and the javadoc.  
I have a java bean that has a org.springframework.web.multipart.MultipartFile property. I attempt to bind my bean with the standard @ModelAttribute annotation. The rest of its properties get resolved correctly but the MultipartFile property is set to null. 
I believe the issue is that on line 106 of the ServletRequestDataBinder it does an instanceof check: "request instanceof MultipartRequest" which will return false because its the HttpMethodRequestWrapper class from the HtmlHiddenMethodFilter. 
However, if I move the property out of my javabean and bind it via a RequestParam annoation, it works correctly. 
public ModelAndView uploadFile(@RequestParam("file") MultipartFile file) {
   // code
}
