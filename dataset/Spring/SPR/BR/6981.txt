Spring TaskScheduler not accurate
I got the latest task-basic spring samples from svn. I have tried to changed the cron expression to "0/10 * * * * ?" and verify the triggering time. I found that the triggering time is not exactly every ONCE for every 10 seconds. It might execute twice and have some time variation.
Mon Mar 15 11:00:40 CST 2010 &lt;-- correct
Mon Mar 15 11:00:49 CST 2010 &lt;-- incorrect time and also should not trigger, as it is incorrect trigger time
Mon Mar 15 11:00:50 CST 2010 &lt;-- trigger twice??
Mon Mar 15 11:01:00 CST 2010 &lt;-- correct again
