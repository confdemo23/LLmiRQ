Favor more locally declared composed annotations over inherited annotations
Background
This issue picks up where SPR-11475 left off.

Status Quo
The implementations of AnnotatedElementUtils and (potentially) Spring&amp;apos;s ASM-based annotation processing currently favor inherited annotations and inherited composed annotations over composed annotations that are declared closer to the starting class passed to getAnnotationAttributes(), getAllAnnotationAttributes(), isAnnotated(), etc.
See the examples and related discussion in SPR-11475 for details.

Deliverables

 Determine which use cases require special treatment with regard to annotation inheritance.
	
Known cases: @Profile and @Conditional


 Reinstate the changes originally introduced in AnnotatedElementUtils for SPR-11475 (i.e., set the searchClassHierarchy to true for all invocations of the internal process() method).
	
Search for SPR-11598 in source code for TODOs.


 Introduce special handling for the known special cases determined in deliverable #1, in order to ensure proper backwards compatibility.
