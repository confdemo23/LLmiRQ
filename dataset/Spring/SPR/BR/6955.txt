TaskExecutor created with task:executor not shutdown when context closes
TaskExecutorFactoryBean does not implement DisposableBean, so there is no callback for the shutdown to happen.  It is easy to verify that the executor is not shut down (you expect to see a log message from it and don&amp;apos;t).  I have no idea why, but the problem seems to be particularly acute in a webapp because for some reason there it prevents the lifecycle processor from completing the shutdown (before timing out).
