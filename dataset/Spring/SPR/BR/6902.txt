@ResponseBody does not work with @ExceptionHandler
When this method is executed






@ExceptionHandler




@ResponseBody




public String dummyExceptionHandler(Exception e) {




    return e.getMessage();




}






Spring mvc tries to resolve the view using the method output --&gt; 404.
As the method is annotated with @ResponseBody, it should directly write the method output to the response.
