Requests URIs containing . cannot be mapped correctly using @RequestMapping in RC3 
I have the following request mapping.
@RequestMapping(value = "/
{username}
/
{domain}
/
{theme}
/
{locale}
/
{documenttype}
", method = RequestMethod.GET)
In RC1 it works like a breeze, regardless the values of the different elements. In RC3, however, whenever a path element contains a . (dot), the URI is not mapped correctly.
In this project, we&amp;apos;re using email addresses as usernames, and this is a major problem for us now.
