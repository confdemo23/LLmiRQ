Impossible to set SimpleMappingExceptionResolver.statusCodes
Bean property &amp;apos;statusCodes&amp;apos; is not writable or has an invalid setter method. Does the parameter type of the setter match the return type of the getter?
indeed :
public void setStatusCodes(Properties statusCodes)
Map&lt;String, Integer&gt; getStatusCodes()
Probably a regression due to SPR-8452. Works with 3.1.0.M2. Maybe works on jdk7 as Introspector was modified.
Why not make statusCodes a Map instead of Properties?
