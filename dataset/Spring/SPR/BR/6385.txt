Context Scanning doesnt work in Jboss 5
Hi All,
When I use context scanning and deploy it on Jboss5. Spring somehow seem to have issue of finding the beans in the classpath. If the same war is dropped on Jboss 4.X it seems to Work just fine.
I tried using the newer Spring3 - m3 as well with no luck.
Any suggestions is appreciated.
