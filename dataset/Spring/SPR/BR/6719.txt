CommonsClientHttpRequestFactory getHttpClient() returns HttpClient from Commons HttpClient 3.x which has been EOL&apos;d
I need to extend CommonsClientHttpRequestFactory and override getHttpClient() in order to use RestTemplate(ClientHttpRequestFactory requestFactory) to make authenticated restful web service calls.  Unfortunately, getHttpClient() returns HttpClient from Commons HttpClient 3.x which has been end-of-life&amp;apos;d (EOL) and is no longer supported.  The CommonsClientHttpRequestFactory and in turn RestTemplate need to use the supported HttpCore 4.x and HttpClient 4.x libraries.
