Failing Rest Template tests on Jelly Bean related to date formatting
Date formatting appears to have changed (broken?) on Jelly Bean. Consider the following format:
"EEE, dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss zzz"
On Android versions prior to Jelly Bean it would format like this:
"Thu, 18 Dec 2008 10:20:00 GMT+00:00"
On Jelly Bean it now looks like this:
"Thu, 18 Dec 2008 10:20:00 GMT"
The tests are currently verifying a date format, but that isn&amp;apos;t what we are actually testing. The tests should be modified to add more date equality comparisons, and work around this change.
