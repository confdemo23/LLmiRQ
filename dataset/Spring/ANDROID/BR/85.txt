HttpBasicAuthentication utilizes an unsupported Base64 library
HttpBasicAuthentication is using the org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Base64 library for Base64 encoding. This library is included in Android, but is not supported, and is not listed in the Android API reference. It will most likely be available to an application, however it is not guaranteed to be present on a given Android device. Android Froyo (2.2) and newer include a supported Base64 library, android.util.Base64. However, earlier versions do not. To support Eclair (2.1) devices we&amp;apos;ll need to include a third party library.
