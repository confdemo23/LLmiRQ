Profile Requested 4 times in login
The is a bug in the org.springframework.social.connect.support.AbstractConnection class in the sign-in process the valuesInitialized flag is not set.
Calling the following methods getDisplayName(), getProfileUrl() and getImageUrl() get the profile from facebook every time instead of using the data already set on the class. If the setValues() method is called is should check if the valuesInitialized flag is set, if not call the apiAdapter, else just return a new new values object.
At present the login for me takes around 12 seconds if the repeated calls to retrieve the profile can be eliminated it should be around 5 seconds.
Thanks
Graham
