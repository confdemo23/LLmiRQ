getProviderIdFromRequest leads to redirectloops
So, I finally figureg out why my site often experiences redirect loops on authentication problems. Spring Social passes as providerId google/ in stead of google. This is because of the hackish way in which the providerId is extracted from the url getProviderIdFromRequest. 
And it&amp;apos;s a private method. So, I can&amp;apos;t fix this by overriding the method
