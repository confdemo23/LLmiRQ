NullPointerException when saving relationship entity with end node field in camel case
Given a relationship entity defined with camel case start/end node fields:
 @StartNode private Actor firstActor;
 @EndNode  private Actor secondActor;
saving it results in an NPE. Field names such as first or second (all lower) work fine. This is due to the conversion of the field name to snake case to find a matching writer.
