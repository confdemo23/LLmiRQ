@TransactionalEventListener not working
I tried to use an transactional event listener with SDN 4 and it is not working.

I looked into the code and when i publish an event there is a check in TransactionSynchronizationManager that checks if there is an active transaction. This check does not find the current transaction.
My next step was to look into Neo4jTransactionManager and AbstractPlatformTransactionManager. In the abstract class I found some code that uses TransactionSynchronizationManager but there is no such code in Neo4jTransactionManager.
Maybe the Neo4jTransactionManager should extend the AbstractPlatformTransactionManager and/or must initialize TransactionSynchronizationManager.
