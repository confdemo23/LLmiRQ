Character conversions on Windows
Under Windows, if you save an Entity with an attribute value:
"Aki Kaurismki"
And then reload that entity, the attribute value loaded back is not the same.This appears to be an encoding issue, possibly because Windows uses UCS-2 encoding by default, and we persist values with UTF-8 encoding.
