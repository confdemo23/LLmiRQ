Derived finders use an incorrect return type and target entity when the finder is defined in a hierarchy
If a derived finder is defined in this manner:






public interface CrudGraphRepository&lt;T extends Entity&gt; extends GraphRepository&lt;T&gt; {




    T findById(String id);




}









public interface UserRepository extends CrudGraphRepository&lt;User&gt; {









}






UserRepository.findById assumes that the return type is Entity and the label to match is also based on Entity. It should be User instead.
Workaround: override the derived finder in UserRepository.
