@QueryResult is not working for field "id"
I have a class annotated with @QueryResult and a field id of type Long:






@QueryResult




public class MappingTest {









    private Long id;









    public Long getId() {




        return this.id;




    }









    public void setId( final Long id ) {




        this.id = id;




    }




}






In my domain objects the id-property is annotated with @GraphId
In a GraphRepository i have a annotated query method:






    @Query("MATCH (a:Attribute) RETURN id(a) as id")




    Iterable&lt;MappingTest&gt; testMe();






When this method is executed i get an list with objects and the id property of each object is null. When i rename the property everything is ok.
In the code i found that in org.neo4j.ogm.metadata.ClassInfo.propertySetters() there is the following check






!methodInfo.getName().equals(identitySetter.getName())






Due to this check the propertySetters() method returns an empty Collection and later on no property-writer is created and the property is not set.
