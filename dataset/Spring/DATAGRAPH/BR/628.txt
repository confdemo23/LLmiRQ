Dynamic queries fail to use the label when defined for a @NodeEntity
 In the previous version of SDN there was the functionality that automatically generated queries from the method name on the Repository interface - e.g. if I had FooRepository and put a method findByBar(String bar) , it would generate a match on Foo.bar property. This seems to work but only partly: I have a repository for CityNeo4j class, but the label is marked to be City on the NodeEntity annotation. This works fine when I manually use neo4jTemplate.loadByProperty, but when the magic interface method is invoked, it generates a match for CityNeo4j label (instead of just City).
