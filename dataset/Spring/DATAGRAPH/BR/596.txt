Unrequested objects being loaded
Reported by: shakeelsoogun@outlook.com
If a longer running session is used, then saving several nodes and attempting to load one of them using the load(id::long) method actually attempts to load all the nodes that were saved during the session (even if attempting to only get one object). Same thing happens with the loading from a collection of IDs. Using shorter sessions or sessions where no saving is done appears to be a workaround to this.
