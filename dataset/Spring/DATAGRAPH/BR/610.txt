Relationship with null properties causes InvalidSyntax 
Created a RelationshipEntity with StartNode, EndNode, and two properties.  org.neo4j.ogm.session.result.ResultProcessingException was thrown with InvalidSyntax.
(line 1, column 89)
MATCH ($47) WHERE id($47)=47 MATCH ($48) WHERE id($48)=48 MERGE ($47)[_1:`RECRUITEDFOR`}]&gt;($48) RETURN id(_1) AS _1
Here there is an extra end bracket.  
Tracked issue to NewRelationshipBuilder lines 72-83.  Coming out of for loop, code assumes last character is a comma and deletes it but if all properties on relationship are null, the last character was the opening bracket.
