Cannot use domain models that are subgraphs
A really stupid bug.
given a graph
(speaker:Speaker)[:PRESENTS]&gt;(talk:Talk)
and a domain model consisting of just one class: 
class Speaker 
{
    Long id;
 }

Speaker instances cannot be created because we expect Talk objects to exist in the object domain, and we throw a MappingException when we can&amp;apos;t find a Talk class to instantiate.
There is no requirement that the graph domain be a surjection of the object domain.
