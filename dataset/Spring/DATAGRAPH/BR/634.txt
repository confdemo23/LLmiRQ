AmbiguousBaseClassException when resolving a hierarchy which contains exactly one superclass and one subclass in a particular order
For classes such as 






@NodeEntity




public abstract class Login {




..




}









@NodeEntity




public class Member extends Login  {




...




}






where Login has exactly one super class and Member has no subclasses, Metadata.resolve throws an AmbiguousBaseClassException when the order of taxa is "Member",Login"
