No Entities/Relationships found on scan on Windows
DomainInfo.java line 244:






   String path = packageName.replace(".", File.separator);






should be:






   String path = packageName.replace(".", "/");






because ON WINDOWS File.separator yields "" and then when compared in ClassPathScanner line 68 with the "/" that are in the ZipFileEntry, nothing ever matches and no entity or relationship classes are registered.
