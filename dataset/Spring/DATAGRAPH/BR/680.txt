Page queries report incorrect total pages and total elements
GraphRepositoryImpl.updatePage takes a guess at how many total elements there are based upon the page offset and page item count.  This only reports how many there are UP TO the current page, not total.  PageImpl then divides total by page size to derive the page count.  Because total is incorrect, total pages then is reported incorrectly.  This makes client programming to report page totals and ask for more pages when there are more very unreliable.  See comment on DATAGRAPH-556.
Suggest Neo4j OGM paging support be updated to return a count when paging is used, so SDN4 can use this to build proper pages.
