DeleteDelegate can not find ClassInfo for my object
There is a change between SDN 4.1.0 M1 and RC1 which breaks my tests. 
I have a test case which relies on CrudRepository&lt;X&gt;.deleteAll() (my repo extends GraphRepository&lt;X&gt; which in eventually extends CrudRepository).
In M1 it worked fine, in RC1 I get a warning "java.lang.Class is not an instance of a persistable class". 
For some reason DeleteDelegate can not find ClassInfo for my object, which was working fine in M1.
