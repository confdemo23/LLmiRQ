Mapping of numeric values to other numeric types
If a node contains numeric data but the class field is of a different type,
eg. long -&gt; int,byte
or double -&gt; float
It fails with a mapping exception while it should coerce the value if it fits and only fail on an overflow.
JSON by default only knows long(ish) and double so all other numeric types will probably pose problems.
