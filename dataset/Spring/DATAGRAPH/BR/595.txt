Cannot specify load depth -1 (load all)
Reported by: shakeelsoogun@outlook.com
Loading with depth -1 to load all possible connected objects does not work as the VariableDepthQuery class uses a "max &gt; 0" check to determine whether something should use the DepthZeroReadStrategy queries instead. However, this means that attempting to use a negative depth (or more specifically, -1 which should load all) actually loads the object with depth 0.
