The constructor DefaultDirContextValidator(int searchScope) does not actually set scope in SearchControls
Call to SearchControls.setSearchScope(int) missing in constructor body. As a consequence one gets the default scope in SearchControls (ONELEVEL) when creating DefaultDirContextValidator with its default constructor (which would like to use OBJECT scope).
