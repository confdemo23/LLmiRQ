Spring LDAP does not correctly parse DN names that has double-quote in the middle
DistinguishedName.parse() is confused upon receiving mangled double-quotes character in the middle of the passed parameter.
Example: DN=Roger "Bunny" Rabbit,DC=somecompany,DC=com
The double-quote character is mangled (not clear by what, JNDI maybe?) so it looks like this " instead of \".
Before parse(): DN=Roger \\"Bunny" Rabbit,DC=somecompany,DC=com
After parse(): DN=Roger 
Solution: I have attached a patch that strips the extra backslash.  Then the parser works and it can handle properly escaped double-quotes just fine.
