DefaultObjectDirectoryMapper#isAtLeast30() produces NullPointerException when bundled into an uberjar
I was trying to leverage Spring LDAP 2.0 within a self contained JAR project (basically, a WAR which is packaged in a JAR file using the maven shade plugin).  When doing so, I get the following exception:
Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException: null
	at org.springframework.ldap.odm.core.impl.DefaultObjectDirectoryMapper.isAtLeast30(DefaultObjectDirectoryMapper.java:80)
Tracing this back, I determined the following call was failing: 






    private boolean isAtLeast30() {




        return SpringVersion.getVersion().compareTo("3.0") &gt; 0;




    }






According to the Spring API documentation, it&amp;apos;s perfectly valid for getVersion to return null, but this code doesn&amp;apos;t check for that scenario.
There needs to be some fallback scenario for this code to handle that issue.
