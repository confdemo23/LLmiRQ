SchemaToJava doesn&apos;t handle dashes in attribute names or attributes that are both may and must
There are many attribute names in Active Directory that include dashes (i.e. msDS-Approx-Immed-Subordinates, see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc220237(v=prot.10).aspx for list).
A dash is not allowed in Java variables or method names so the classes generated by SchemaToJava don&amp;apos;t compile. 
Another issue is that some attributes are listed as both may and must, presumably because they are listed one way in a super-type and another way in a sub-type.
The attached patch should address both issues. It adds a "getJavaName()" method to AttributeSchema that currently just removes all dashes but could be changed to do additional cleanup if necessary. 
If an attribute is in both the may and must list it should be put in the must list only.
