Active Directory -- DirContextAdapter.addAttribute, removeAttribute does not work correctly
I&amp;apos;m using spring-ldap against an Active Directory based LDAP server.  I&amp;apos;d like to manage user-group memberships by adding and removing users to groups. 
When deleting a membership I use the following code on the looked up group context instance:
context.removeAttributeValue("member", member);
this.ldapTemplate.modifyAttributes(context);
Where member is a String that comes from DistinguishedName.toString(), the problem is when instantiating DistinguishedNames with the constructor that takes one String as argument, the attribute names of LdapRdns become lowercase (e.g.: "OU=Sample,OU=Foo" becomes "ou=sample,ou=foo") while parsing. AD has the habit of converting all lowercase key values to uppercase, and thus when trying to call removeAttributeValue with the dn provided, the actual value is not found and therefore no deletion occurs. The same issue occurs when using addAttributeValue.
I don&amp;apos;t know if it is strictly a spring-ldap issue, but it would be good to have some kind of solution. Maybe somehow to be able to preserve the case of the DistinguishedName components would be sufficient.
Thanks is advance,
M.
