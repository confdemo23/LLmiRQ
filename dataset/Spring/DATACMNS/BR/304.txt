Misleading documentation of page parameter resolved by PageableArgumentResolver
PageableArgumentResolver is not resolving page parameter. To use pagination, you will have to use page.page
So either table 1.1. needs an update or PageableArgumentResolver has to be changed to use the documented parameter
