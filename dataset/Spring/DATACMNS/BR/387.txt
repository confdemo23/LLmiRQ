Potential NullPointerExceptions in PartTree area
When creating a PartTree for an empty predicate (e.g. findAllByOrderByFooAsc) we create a Part with a null PropertyPath. This causes issues later on when this path is consumed excepting it not to be null at any time.
We should reject the invalid parameters handed around in the value objects more aggressively and even prevent the creation of a Part in the PartTree if the string is empty at this point.
