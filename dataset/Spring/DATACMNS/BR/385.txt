DefaultRepositoryInformation#getTargetClassMethod matches wrong save-Method if Entity implements Iterable
If an entity implements Iterable and I try to use SimpleJpaRepository#save(Iterable) to save a list of these entities, the code sometimes fails because DefaultRepositoryInformation#getTargetClassMethod(Method, Class) matches the save(Object)-method, depending which of the two save-methods is checked first in the loop.
To reproduce this behaviour reliably, I had to set a breakpoint in the for-Loop of getTargetClassMethod() and make sure, that the method save(Object) is called before the save(Iterable) for a list of iterable entities.
