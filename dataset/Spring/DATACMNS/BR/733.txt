PreferredConstructorDiscoverer prevents custom classloader from being garbage collected
Hi,
the reason for this issue is similar/related to the one described in DATACMNS-648:
PreferredConstructorDiscoverer creates a static DefaultParameterNameDiscoverer, wich adds a LocalVariableTableParameterNameDiscoverer to parameterNameDiscoverers. This LVTPND holds a Map with a class as a key.
As I said, I&amp;apos;m using a custom classloaders for a kind of plugin-based application.
The problem is, since entity-classes stay in the LVTPND&amp;apos;s parameterNamesCache, the custom classloader who loaded the entity class can never be GC&amp;apos;ed.
Also note that MethodParameters could potentially cause the same problems because of the static DefaultParameterNameDiscoverer
Regards
