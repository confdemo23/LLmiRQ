Custom implementation of repository fails when overriding methods containing generics
I am using the method for creating custom implementation of repositories, as described (among other places) here. This works great for just about all methods, including methods from the standard CrudRepository and PagingAndSortingRepository like Page&lt;T&gt; findAll(Pageable pageable). However, this does not work if the method defined in CrudRepository or PagingAndSortingRepository contains parameters with generics, like T findOne(ID id).
Why am I doing this you ask? Well, I am trying to find a work around while waiting for DATACMNS-293. This allows me to implement the methods manually, while keeping all the goodness of the restful exposure code as-is, which given QueryDSL is suprisingly simple and I am nearly questioning the need for the solution in DATACMNS-293...
The following patch fixes the issue for me, but I am not able to see if this has further unwanted ramifications:
