NullableWrapper Breaks JSON Conversion
Since an upgrade to JPA 1.6 RC1, Spring MVC fails to properly address a NullableWrapper and this is returned, with the contents contained with the NullableWrapper.
I have a MVC method that is returning:






public Callable&lt;Set&lt;Pos&gt;&gt; get(.....) {




    final Set&lt;Pos&gt; allPos = posService.findAll();




    return ImmutableSortedSet.copyOf(allPos);




}






With Spring Data JPA 1.5., I get on the wire a set of Pos&amp;apos;s in JSON format, i.e.,






[{"name: "pos1"}, {"name: "pos2"}]






With Spring Data JPA 1.6 RC1, I now get the NullableWrapper with Contents:






[valueType: "java.util.ArrayList", value: [{"name: "pos1"}, {"name: "pos2"}]]
