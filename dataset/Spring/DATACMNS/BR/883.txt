NullPointerException for Querydsl bindings referring to collection element attributes
Assume you have a domain model like this:






class User {




  List&lt;Address&gt; addresses;




}









class Address {




  String street;




}






Referring to the property addresses.street via Querydsl-backed web requests doesn&amp;apos;t work as we&amp;apos;re inspecting the properties in the Querydsl generated classes, and the ListPath generated for addresses needs a dedicated any() lookup to get back to the EntityPath for the element predicates.
Manually specifying a binding, doesn&amp;apos;t help either as the translation into a PropertyPath fails, as we currently rely on the toString() representation of the PathMetadata, which in case of the usage of any() returns any(user.addresses).street.
We need to fix the to-dot-path translation in that step and should add the implicit call to any() for derived path expressions in case we encounter a Path that points to a collection.
