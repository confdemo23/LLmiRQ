Potential NullPointerException in ResultProcessor
According to the JavaDoc ResultProcessor.processResult() allows null to be handed as result, which makes sense as a query result to be processed can be null. However, null is not handled implicitly or explicitly and will yield an exception being thrown from ProjectionFactory as a projection is attempted downstream.
We should handle null explicitly and eagerly return the value as is.
