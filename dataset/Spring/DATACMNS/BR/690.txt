Multi-store silently ignores repository creation failures
Basic use case is presented here
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-examples/tree/master/multi-store
In my use case we did not put @Document on mongo annotations. Therefore, when I migrated our application to the latest version of spring boot (hence the latest version of spring data), my repositories were not created in the context.
It was very hard to guess that this happened as this is notified on a DEBUG level.
Fyi, we have a @Enable*Repositories which points to separate packages to avoid confusion on repository creation, therefore, it is was not trivial to understand the existence of this "strict" mode.
