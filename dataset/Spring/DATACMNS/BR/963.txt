ReturnedType.getInputProperties() does not guarantee distinct properties
In case inheritance is used in projection interfaces and an accessor method is redeclared, the property is returned twice in ReturnedType.getInputProperties(). The reason for that is that the accessor methods are backed by different PropertyDescriptor instances as they&amp;apos;re unique per declared type.
