Upgrade to latest Querydsl
Hello,
Unit tests against spring-data-commons-core don&amp;apos;t run on JDK 1.7. 
It happens because spring-data-commons-core depends on querydsl 2.2.0 version which has a known bug. Please see https://bugs.launchpad.net/querydsl/+bug/819861
This issue was fixed in 2.2.1, so after I updated dependency everything works fine.
Regards,
Alexey.
