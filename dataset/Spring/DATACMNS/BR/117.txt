Add HandlerMethodArgumentResolver alternative to the PageableArgumentResolver
It is recommended to re-implement WebArgumentResolver types as HandlerMethodArgumentResolver in Spring 3.1. Although a WebArgumentResolver is adapted transparently to the new contract, as the javadoc for AbstractWebArgumentResolverAdapter indicates, a HandlerMethodArgumentResolver.supportsParameter(MethodParameter) method can only be implemented by actually calling WebArgumentResolver.resolve() and checking if the return value is UNRESOLVED. If an exception occurs during that check, it isn&amp;apos;t clear if the failure is because the parameter can not be supported or whether there was some other real failure. As a result the exception has to be absorbed and other resolvers given a chance instead.
