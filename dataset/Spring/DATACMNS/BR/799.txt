Pageable&apos;s size should not be dependent on 1-based or 0-based paging.
In this controller :






@RequestMapping("/list")




public String list(Model model , Pageable pageable) {




  logger.info("pageable = {}" , pageable);




  // ... skipped




}






My goal : I want Spring automatically build this pageable object from page and size parameter of URL , which page starts from 1.
The solution is here : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34459658
First , I feel the API design of `addArgumentResolvers` is problematic . It has to call super.addArgumentResolvers(argumentResolvers) at the end of the method.
It should be able to designed to just add the resolver to argumentResolvers and make it work.
And here is the point : resolver.setOneIndexedParameters(true) will also change the meaning of size , it is very counter-intuitive.
In most people&amp;apos;s intuition , no matter page starts from 1 or 0 , size should not be dependent on that value.
But when I code : 






resolver.setMaxPageSize(10);




resolver.setOneIndexedParameters(true);






And pass ?page=1&amp;size=10 in the URL . The receiving size becomes 9 . It should be fixed.
