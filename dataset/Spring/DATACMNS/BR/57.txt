Use of parameterized type in constructor arguments is not supported
When an object contains a List of another object (no simple types), the MongoMappingConverter finds correct generic type for the field, but when this field is used in the PersistenceConstructor, the type is considered to be the raw type and then no information is available to convert batck the DBObject instances for this list.
In the TypeDiscover class, the method getParameterTypes(Constructor&lt;?&gt;) use the reflection method Class&lt;?&gt;[] Constructor.getParameterTypes() that give no hint on the generic parameter types. I replaced this call with Type[] Constructor::getGenericParameterTypes(), that has solved my problem.
