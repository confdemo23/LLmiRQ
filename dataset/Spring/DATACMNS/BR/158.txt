Stack overflow caused by digits in unknown property names
When org.springframework.data.mapping.PropertyPath tries to find a non-existent property that contains any digit (e.g. when a finder method with a mistyped property name and a digit has been added to repository interface) PropertyPath.create() method goes into a long recursion which causes StackOverflowError.
Removing digits from the finder method causes IllegalArgumentException with a helpful error message (property not found etc.) as expected.
Attaching stack-trace and a sample test project that uses a JPA repository.
