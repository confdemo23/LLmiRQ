Cache Annotations in AnnotationBasedPersistentProperty
Looking up annotations every time from Java reflection is prohibitively expensive.
So please cache them.
Read annotations from getters, setters and the field and store them in a map with the same precendence rules as findAnnotation(type)
use that cache in isAnnotationPresent() and findAnnotation().
Also provide a getAnnotations() method that returns all annotations on that property. This collection would be used for Bean-Validation (JSR-303) and other methods that have to check meta-annotations.
