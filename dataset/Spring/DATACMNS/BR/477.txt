PageableHandlerMethodArgumentResolver.setFallbackPageable(null) does not work as specified
The javadoc indicates that passing null to this method is valid and should result in a null value handed into the controller method.  However if a null value is passed the result is a NullPointerException thrown from the resolveArgument() method.  It is clear from the implementation code in resolveArgument() that a null default is not anticipated.  The fix is relatively trivial: the resolveArgument() method simply needs to return null if the defaultOrFallback value is null.
The ability to provide null as a default value allows an application to support both paged and non paged results from a single controller method, depending on whether the page parameters are passed in.  The workaround is to declare separate methods and use request mappings to differentiate them based on presence of the page parameters in the request, but this seems awkward compared to being able to simply test for a null pageable.
