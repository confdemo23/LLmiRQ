PageImpl can not be constructed with empty content
When passing empty list to PageImpl constructor (e.g. in a test, when mocking repository method which returns Page), PageRequest is instantiated with "content.size()" as page size, but 0 size is not allowed argument value in PageRequest.
BTW, 1.0 M5 DATACMNS is not marked as released in JIRA, but it is, as part of or together with DATAJPA 1.0 M2 release.
