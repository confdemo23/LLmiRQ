AbstractMappingContext has to init domain classes in afterPropertiesSet()
We have to revert the fix introduced for DATACMNS-179 as this leaves MappingContext implementations in uninitialized state at container init stages when other application components might already rely on the context being fully initialized.
E.g. this could be a MongoDB query execution in an init method of a component that relies on all persistent entities being known in advance.
