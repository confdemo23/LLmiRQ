"Ambigious command" if one command name starts with another command name
A command like






public class FoobarCommand




		implements CommandMarker




{




	@CliCommand(value = "foo")




	public String foo() {}









	@CliCommand(value = "fooBar")




	public String fooBar() {}




}






prints
Ambigious command &amp;apos;foo&amp;apos; (for assistance press TAB or type "hint" then hit ENTER)
when entering foo and pressing enter.
A similar issue ROO-726 - Ambigious command in Shell has previously been closed as "Won&amp;apos;t Fix" but I&amp;apos;d suggest to reconsider this. The current behavior is very surprising and unexpected...
