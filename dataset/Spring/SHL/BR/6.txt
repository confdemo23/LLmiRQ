Spring Shell does not support "help"
Currently, when user type "help" in Spring shell,  no help message is displayed (as following):
spring&gt;help
Command &amp;apos;help&amp;apos; not found (for assistance press TAB or type "hint" then hit ENTER)
The expected resut is that all available commands should be listed.
