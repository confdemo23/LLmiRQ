Cursor on Line "2" of the shell instead of the old position after using flash messages
I am using the flash methods to print some progress informations from the commands.
If i am on line 8 of my shell and i am using the flash call, the cursor is back on line 2 after the command finished.
This is really "ugly" because their may be already some output on the shell and its confusing compared to bash or other shells behavior - don&amp;apos;t know a workarounds yet or what may causing this.
I would expect to be on the next line (9) with a "fresh" prompt after the command finished - like all other commands which does not print something with "flash".
