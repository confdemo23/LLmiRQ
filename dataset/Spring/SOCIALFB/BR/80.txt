OperationNotPermittedException thrown when an InsufficientPermissionException should have been thrown.
Facebook has recently started improving its errors from the Graph API. This is a good thing (the existing errors left much to be desired). However, the side effect of this is that FacebookErrorHandler may now throw the wrong exception in some cases.
One such case is when the user has not authorized an application to post to their feed and a post is attempted. An InsufficientPermissionException is expected, but instead an OperationNotPermittedException is thrown. 
This issue addresses this specific case. A separate task will be created for reviewing Facebook&amp;apos;s new errors and updating FacebookErrorHandler appropriately for all cases.
