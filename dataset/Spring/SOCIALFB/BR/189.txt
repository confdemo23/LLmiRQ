Error deserializing null into primitives when using Jackson 2.6
Prior to Jackson 2.6 custom deserializers apparently weren&amp;apos;t even used if the field to be deserialized was null...consequently, they would remain at the default value. An int, for example, would be left as 0.
Starting with Jackson 2.6, the custom deserializer will be used even if the field is null, resulting in a NPE attempting to deserialize null into a non-nullable primitive.
This can be fixed by overriding the getNullValue() method in any custom deserializers such as AchievementPointsDeserializer.
