NPE when FB sends back data for likes instead of count
Sometimes Facebook sends back a count for the number of people who have "liked" a post and sometimes they send back data containing references to those people who liked the post. Currently, PostMixin is written to assume that it will receive the count and will fail when it receives reference data. This should be written to more gracefully handle either situation.
