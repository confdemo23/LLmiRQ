ItemProvider still referenced in comments / variable naming in ItemOrientedTasklet
In ItemOrientedTasklet, parameter and member field are called itemProvider but method name and type are ItemReader - this is inconsistent. Additionally, ItemReader is still referred to as ItemProvider inconsistently throughout comments.
