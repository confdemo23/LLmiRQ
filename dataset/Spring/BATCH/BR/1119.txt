afterWrite() will only be called if an exception is raised during throttling
If a chunk fails during write() then the recovery procedure will kick in.  But if all of the items pass during throttling, then no exception will be raised to try the chunk again.  Thus, the afterWrite() method will never be called because that method is only called by SimpleChunkProcessor.doWrite().
