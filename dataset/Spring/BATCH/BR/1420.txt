Late Binding only happens first time when using inner bean definition with collection property
Using the Partitioning method, attempting to access the separate ExecutionContexts as setup by my Partitioner only works on the first step. All subsequent steps seem to use the same ExecutionContext variables. This appears to be caused by the binding not happening at all on the later steps, essentially recycling the previous values.
