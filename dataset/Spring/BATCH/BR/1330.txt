Wrong JavaDoc in CommandLineJobRunner concerning Parameters
It seems to me that the documentation of the command line arguments for CommandLineJobRunner in the JavaDoc class comment is wrong. It says the parameters are "java jobPath jobName jobLauncherPath jobParameters...".
First of all I would remove "java" here. But jobLauncherPath seams to be really wrong. There is no such parameter.
The JavaDoc for "main(String[])" says there are the parameters are "jobPath, jobName, jobParameters...". And the code seams to proof that.
