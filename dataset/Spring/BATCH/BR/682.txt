Use SoftReference and/or expiry to store entries in RetryContextCache implementation(s)
Use SoftReference and/or expiry to store entries in RetryContextCache implementation(s).  If the map-based cache is used in a multi-VM environment, stale cache entries can easily be accumulated inadvertently because the successful processing of a previously failed item happened on a different node than the original failure.  A good start would be to use SoftReferences in the map-based implementation.  Expiry and more complicated features would be best left to mature cache technologies, and custom implementations of the RetryContextCache interface.
