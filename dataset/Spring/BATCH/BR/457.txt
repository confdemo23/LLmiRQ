Error handling broken in SimpleJob
SimpleJob.execute() uses rethrow() to rethrow all Throwables caught during execution.  rethrow checks to see if something is a RuntimeException and wraps it if it is not.
the issue is that anything that is an Error (OutOfMemory, StackOverflow, etc.) is caught and wrapped as an UnexpectedJobExecutionException.  errors are inadvertently reclassified as exceptions.
honestly, i think that it&amp;apos;s a little dodgy to be catching errors anyway, but if you must, rethrow needs to be corrected.
