transactional reader does not work since 2.2
Hello,
It seems that the property "reader-transactional-queue" on a chunk does not work since 2.2.
The value of the property is not set to FaultTolerantStepBuilder and then the property is ignored.
Then when the chunk is in skipping process the items are not re-read if the property is setting to "true".
Adding the line code:
if (readerTransactionalQueue!=null &amp;&amp; readerTransactionalQueue==true) 
{
			builder.readerIsTransactionalQueue();
		}

in the method  createFaultTolerantStep() of org.springframework.batch.core.configuration.xml.StepParserStepFactoryBean fixes the problem. (see the attachement)
