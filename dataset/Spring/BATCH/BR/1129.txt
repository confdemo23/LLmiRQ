Problems with exception classifications
Transaction attributes of the following form don&amp;apos;t seem to be preventing rollback:
    transaction-attribute="+org.springframework.dao.DataIntegrityViolationException"
It does, however, seem to be causing the job to fail.   ie, it&amp;apos;s treated as a fatal exception and prevents skipping.
Furthermore, all exceptions seem to be skippable by default, whereas they should be fatal unless specifically configured to be skippable.
There are some complications listed in BATCH-859, so if those complications make these scenarios impossible, that needs to be documented.
