Spring Batch and Hibernate Search do not work together
We are having a problem when using spring batch and hibernate search together.   Basically when hibernate search needs to lazy load a entity using indexing (which occurs during the commit processing) we get a lazy load exception (org.hibernate.LazyInitializationException: could not initialize proxy - no Session).
I&amp;apos;m pretty sure this problem is caused by the call to hibernateTemplate.clear() in HibernateItemWriter:
	public final void write(List&lt;? extends T&gt; items) {
		doWrite(hibernateTemplate, items);
		try 
{
			hibernateTemplate.flush();
		}
		finally 
{
			// This should happen when the transaction commits anyway, but to be
			// sure...
			hibernateTemplate.clear();
		}
	}
As the affect of this is also to clear the session on any hibernate proxies.  
As the comment says, the clear should not be needed and I would suggest either removing it or at least making it configurable.
