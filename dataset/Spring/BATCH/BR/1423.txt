Upon job restart, step with FlatFileItemReader doesn&apos;t honor skippable-exception-classes
Cloned from: BATCH-1418 to allow this to be closed for 2.0.4.
Upon restarting a failed step, the reader (FlatFileItemReader) tries to parse the file from the beginning as it tries to reach the point from where it has to pick up after the last failure. Along the way, the reader invokes the lineTokenizer and the fieldSetMapper for each of the already processed records. This appears to be far too much work for no gain when the point is to quickly get to the last record read from the file that was successfully committed. 
More importantly, during this recovery phase, the parsing exercise triggers parsing exceptions but the batch framework doesn&amp;apos;t honor the "skippable-exception-classes" instruction. This causes exceptions (that should be skipped) to become fatal and the job fails to restart.
