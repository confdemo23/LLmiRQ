Skip method should get ExecutionContext as an argument
Skippable readers and writers are, most of the time, going to keep some sort of statistic about how much or what was skipped. It makes sense for these collaborators to have the ExecutionContext directly supplied as an argument the skip method rather than making each Skippable have to also implement StepListener to become context aware.
Since this is a change to a public API, requesting consideration for 1.0.0 release. Please vote / comment ASAP. Thanks.
