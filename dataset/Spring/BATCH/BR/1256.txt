Processor is called (and committed) many times for the same items if Writer skips
Processor is called (and committed) many times for the same items if Writer skips.
Assume the commit interval is 5 and the Reader reads items [1,2,3,4,5].  
If the Writer fails on "4", the following represents the items that are passed into the Processor:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5, 4, 5, 5]
And the following are the processed items that are committed:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5, 5]
The Processor should not be receiving the same items over and over.  Furthermore, not processed item should be committed more than once.
