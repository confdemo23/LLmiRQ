Problem with FlatFileItemWriter restart using multi-byte encoding
With FlatFileItemWriter, size saved in the step_context on update (under current.count key) is the sum of fileChannel.size (current file size in bytes) and Buffered string length (see FlatFileItemWriter.OutputState.position() method)
With an out file encoded in UTF-8 and buffer string containing two bytes caracters, the saved position is wrong =&gt; restart will erase out file content.
In attachment, maven project with :

a first test case comparing real file size after a 1rst job run with failure and current.countsaved data
a second test case comparing in file size and out file size after a 1rst job run with failure and a 2nd job restart with no failure
