Remove close() method from non ItemStreams
The following classes have a default close method implementation which does not belong and should be removed:
org.springframework.batch.execution.launch.EmptyItemWriter
org.springframework.batch.item.writer.ItemWriterAdapter
org.springframework.batch.item.reader.ItemReaderAdapter
Here&amp;apos;s an interesting question  how do you deal with something that needs to be both an ItemStream and a RepeatInterceptor?
Take org.springframework.batch.io.support.HibernateAwareItemWriter for instance  suppose you want this to be transaction managed as an ItemStream, how would you do that?
