Make sure WRITE_COUNT and ROLLBACK_COUNT are being updated correctly
From a forum post:
Using FlatFileItemReader and loading the records into database.  File has 55 records and 55th record is skipped. Commit interval is 100.
Results in:
    READ_COUNT: 55
    WRITE_COUNT: 108
    WRITE_SKIP_COUNT: 1
    ROLLBACK_COUNT: 2
    COMMIT_COUNT: 1
Database was correctly loaded with 54 records. But WRITE_COUNT and ROLLBACK_COUNT are misleading.
