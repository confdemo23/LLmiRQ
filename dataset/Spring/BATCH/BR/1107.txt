Fix Date conversion in PlaceholderTargetSource
Spring doesn&amp;apos;t do type conversion to String very well, and for Date not at all.  This leads to problems for placeholders of type Date.  There are two issues in the current implementation:
  &lt;property name="foo" value="#
{jobParameters[runDate]}
"/&gt;
fails even if the "foo" property is of type Date because the String conversion is attempted too early; and 
  &lt;property name="query" value="select ... where start_date &gt; &amp;apos;#
{jobParameters}
&amp;apos;"/&gt;
fails because the placeholder is embedded in a literal and needs to be converted to String (which Spring doesn&amp;apos;t do natively).
