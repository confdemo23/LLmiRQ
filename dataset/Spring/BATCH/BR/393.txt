DefaultFieldSet should not always trim whitespace from the value returned
DefaultFieldSet should not always trim whitespace from the value returned.  (I think it&amp;apos;s valid for trimming to occur on the "name" of a field.)  It&amp;apos;s a valid use-case for people to want the raw data that was read with whitespace included.  (It also can slightly slow performance during the reading of a file when trimming is done).
Please allow users to decide which field(s) they would like trimming to occur on.
