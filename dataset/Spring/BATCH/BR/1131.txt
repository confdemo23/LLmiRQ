It is not possible to set transaction-attributes for a tasklet step
When creating a chunk-oriented step, a "transaction-attribute"  can be configured on the &lt;tasklet/&gt; element.  However, since tasklet steps do not use the &lt;tasklet/&gt; element (they use the &amp;apos;tasklet&amp;apos; attribute) there is no place to configure a transaction-attribute.  If the user must use Spring&amp;apos;s "tx" namespace and provide transaction advice, then this should be mentioned in the documentation.
