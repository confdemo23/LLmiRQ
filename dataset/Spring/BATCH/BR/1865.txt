SimpleChunkProvider calls afterRead listener even if the file is finished
the doRead method of SimpleChunkProvider always calls listener.afterRead even if the returned item is null.
A null returned item indicates the file is complete, so the doRead shouldn&amp;apos;t be calling the afterRead listener.
