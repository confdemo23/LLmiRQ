StepExecutionListener.afterStep() should only be called on success
StepExecutionListener.afterStep() should only be called on success.  The interface javadocs don&amp;apos;t say this, but I think it makes more sense for this callback to come only on a successful completion (since there is an onError() callback for the failure case).
