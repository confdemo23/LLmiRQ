MultipleColumnJdbcKeyGenerator, various
In class: org.springframework.batch.io.driving.support.MultipleColumnJdbcKeyGenerator
1) Method setRestartQuery is a duplicate method of setRestartSql
2) The restart data key mapper (field keyMapper of type StreamContextRowMapper) should probably not be settable ...
3) ... it should probably be renamed from keyMapper to something to the effect of restartKeyMapper...
4) ... accordingly, a separate injectable keyMapper should be added (symmetrically with the SingleColumn version)  it&amp;apos;s useless for me to map my results to restart data, I need to map it to a business domain object
