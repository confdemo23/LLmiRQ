onSkipInProcess called multiple times for same item using FaultTolerantChunkOrientedTasklet
If there are skips during the writing of the chunk then the items in the chunk are processed twice again and the onSkipInProcess gets called for each time the chunk is processed.
The basic sequence of events:

read chunk


process chunk - some items cause process skip and the items are removed from chunk and placed in skip list
onSkipInProcess called for skipped items
write chunk - exception thrown for one item


process chunk without the process skips
onSkipInProcess called again for skipped items
write individual chunks - exception thrown for same item  and the item is removed from the chunk
onSkipInWrite called


process chunk without the process or write skips
write chunk without the process or write skips
onSkipInProcess called again for skipped items

Seems that we should remove the skips from the skip list after the first onSkipInProcess is completed or supress the call once it has been made for the skip list.
