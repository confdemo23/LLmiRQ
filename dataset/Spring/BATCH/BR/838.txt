TimeoutTerminationPolicy does not terminate when eof is encountered
The isCompleted methods of TimeoutTerminationPolicy (both the one implemented in the class and the one inherited from CompletionPolicySupport) does not seem to take end-of-file into account., They returns false until the timeout-time is up, even if the exitCode of the ExitStatus parameter changes to "COMPLETED"  when an eof is reached (looking at the constants in ExitStatus I should have guessed that the status should be "FINISHED"....). The result is lots of extra reads that all gets end-of-file.
