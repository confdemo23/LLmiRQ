FaultTolerantChunkProcessor contains dangerous log statements
I&amp;apos;ve just profiled an application that is making an extensive use of Spring Batch. And believe the biggest performance hog was....... 
the StringBuilder conversions in FaultTolerantChunkProcessor class. There are couple of log statements there that do this:
logger.debug("Attempting to write: " + inputs);
without 
if(logger.isDebugEnabled()).
I mean, guys, come on, inputs can be pretty wacky. In this case it was a list of Hibernate entities containing a lot of properties and all of them are in the toString() implementation. This "innocent" logging statement was the biggest performance hog in the app. 
It probably would make sense to do an audit and see if there are any other places where such debug statement are not safe. I suppose I could do that. Would you take a patch?
