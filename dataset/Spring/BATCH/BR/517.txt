item writers need to handle empty flush gracefully
In case "item_count mod commit_interval == 0" there will be an empty extra chunk that only calls the item reader that will return null to indicate all items have been read. This results in flushing item writer without calling write(item) previously - an "empty" flush, that needs to be handled gracefully (e.g. BatchSqlUpdateItemWriter throws a confusing exception).
In principle the execution logic should be smart enough not to do silly things such as empty flushing, but it&amp;apos;s unrealistic to fix for 1.0. Making sure writers handle empty flushing gracefully should be good enough for now.
