Add getStep(String) to Job interface
I find AbstractJobTests very useful, but the implementation is awkward, and there are other situations where I can imagine asking the Job for a specific Step.  However getSteps() should remain an implementation detail for the SimpleJob.  I think it is debatable whether getStep(String) belongs on the interface in fact, so let&amp;apos;s have a thin and a chat about it first, but at least it could go on AbstractJob.
