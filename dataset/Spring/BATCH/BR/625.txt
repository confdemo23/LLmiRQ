SkipListener#onSkipInWrite(..) called multiple times for the same item and not called without rollback
SkipListener#onSkipInWrite(..) is called every time the problematic item is encountered i.e. multiple times in case of rollbacks. It should instead be called once per skipped item (i.e. the listener should be called when the write error was encountered and the item was marked for future skipping).
