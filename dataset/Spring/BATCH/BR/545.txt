RetryTemplate swallows Throwables that are not Exception or Error
The following code is missing an else clause that would rethrow unclassified throwable as RetryException perhaps:
private static void unwrapAndThrow(Throwable ex) throws Exception {
		if (ex instanceof Exception) 
{
			throw (Exception) ex;
		}
		else if (ex instanceof Error) 
{
			throw (Error) ex;
		}
}
