FlatFileItemWriter no longer uses LineAggregator
It seems that the FlatFileItemWriter no longer takes a LineAggregator to determine how lines should be written. This seems to be an oversight?
It could be argued that the ItemTransformer that&amp;apos;s injectable could be used instead, except that it only gets invoked when the item type is not String. Additionally, it is asymmetrical with the ItemReader&amp;apos;s LineTokenizer. Also, there is no packaged ItemTransformer equivalent to the LineAggregators.
Anyway, as of the moment, it seems the LineAggregators are not used or injectable anywhere, so they should either be made injectable and invoked appropriately again, OR equivalent ItemTransformers should be provided and the LineTokenizers should also be replaced, and the transformer should be invoked even if the item is a String...
