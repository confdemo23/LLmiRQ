rollback of first chunk fails
The attached test (a modification of the current one) shows that a roll back that occurs in the first chunk, of a step, does not properly reset the input source to the first record. But, instead, continues with the next record after the rollback is executed.
I believe the solution is to call the inputreader.mark() as part of the open() method in DefaultFlatFileInputSource.java
