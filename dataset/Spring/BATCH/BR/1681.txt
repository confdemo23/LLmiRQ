Restarting a job that generates XML output using StaxEventItemWriter with Woodstox fails
When restarting a job that generates XML output using StaxEventItemWriter, the restart will fail if the Woodstox implementation of Stax is used. The problem is that by default, the Woodstox implementation of XMLEventWriter validates the XML structure as it is written. Since on a restart the root element is not written, when the second output item is written, the Woodstox implementation detects this as an invalid XML structure and throws:
javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamException: Trying to output second root, &lt;item&gt;
The solution is to turn off structure validation in StaxEventItemWriter.open(long, boolean) in much the same way that the "com.ctx.wstx.automaticEndElements" feature is disabled:
if (outputFactory.isPropertySupported("com.ctc.wstx.outputValidateStructure")) {
    outputFactory.setProperty("com.ctc.wstx.outputValidateStructure", Boolean.FALSE);
}
