Use FORWARD_ONLY as scroll mode in HibernateCursorItemReader
When using a HibernateCursorItemReader with the thin Oracle Database Driver hughe amounts of date lead to a Memory Exception. The current implementation doesn&amp;apos;t set the cursor that is opened to FORWARD_ONLY. FORWARD_ONLY disables the caching in the driver, otherwise every row that is fetched is stored in the drivers caching mechanism.
A possible fix for this issue is: 
if (useStatelessSession) {
  statelessSession = sessionFactory.openStatelessSession();
  cursor = statelessSession.createQuery(queryString).scroll(FORWARD_ONLY);
} else {
  statefulSession = sessionFactory.openSession();
  cursor = statefulSession.createQuery(queryString).scroll(FORWARD_ONLY);
}
