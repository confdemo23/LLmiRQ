JobRegistryBeanPostProcessor skips jobs in XML namespace unless they are injected as dependency
The factory bean JobParserJobFactoryBean is not a SmartFactoryBean, so its instances do not get instantiated eagerly by default.  Not many use cases need this, but the JobRegistry is a special case as Job instances typically are not dependencies for anything.
