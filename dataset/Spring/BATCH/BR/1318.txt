Ensure exception classes are behaving correctly
There seem to be a few problems with the way the exception classes are being handled:
BATCH-1327: 1) If the exception is not registered as skippable (on a step with a skip-limit), then it should be treated exactly as if it were registered as fatal (stop processing immediately).  However, right now the chunk seems to be rolling back, and reprocessing before finally failing.
BATCH-1333: 2) Exceptions registered as retryable and fatal are not being retried.
BATCH-1332: 3) Skippable + No-Rollback exceptions show inconsistent rollback behavior.  No rollback occurs for the initial writing of the chunk but rollback seems to occur during scanning.
BATCH-1331: 4) Fatal + No-Rollback exceptions are causing the chunk to be reprocessed, leading to double-commits for valid records.
BATCH-1334: 5) Non-Skippable + No-Rollback exceptions are being treated as skippable.
