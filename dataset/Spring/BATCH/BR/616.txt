Possible overflow in exit description if a stream.open() throws exception
Possible overflow in exit description if a stream.open() throws exception.  Since we only truncate the exitStatus.description on update, if an exception is thrown before the initial insert would normally happen (ItemOrientedStep.doExecute) then the description could overflow the database column.  Fix would be to truncate on insert as well.
