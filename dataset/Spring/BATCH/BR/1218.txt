item streams won&apos;t get registered if ItemStream reader is used with step
I tried to use following configuration for a step:
				&lt;bean id="myStep" parent="skipLimitStep"&gt;
					&lt;property name="itemReader" ref="mergingReader" /&gt;
					...
					&lt;property name="streams"&gt;
						&lt;list&gt;
							&lt;ref bean="file321Reader"/&gt;
							&lt;ref bean="file324Reader"/&gt;
							&lt;ref bean="mergingReader" /&gt;
						&lt;/list&gt;
					&lt;/property&gt;
mergingReader merges data from two FlatFileItemReader delegates. This reader needs to be stateful - have to implement ItemStream to allow restart. When the step is started (FaultTolerantStepFactoryBean) it correctly registers those readers but after that it automatically registers mergingReader (as it is reader which implements ItemStream) and replaces the stream definition so that only mergingReader&amp;apos;s open() is called. 
I believe the problem is in FaultTolerantStepFactoryBean.registerStreams() method.
Maybe something like this would help (ChunkMonitor.getItemStream() would have to be implemented):
if (chunkMonitor.getItemStream() != null) {
    composite.register(chunkMonitor.getItemStream());
}
chunkMonitor.setItemStream(composite);
... grr, now i see, this would call the auto-registered reader&amp;apos;s open() method twice, huh, at least I tried
