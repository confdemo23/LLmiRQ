The term "exit code" is overloaded
In the ExitStatus class exit code refers to the string representing the exit status e.g. FAILED
In the CommandLineJobRunner exit code refers to what will be returned to the OS
One of these should be changed to remove confusion, e.g.
 return exitCodeMapper.getExitCode(jobExecution.getExitStatus().getExitCode());  
At first glance can you tell what the heck this does?
