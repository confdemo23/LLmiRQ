JdbcStepExecutionDao isn&apos;t deserializing objects correctly.
I&amp;apos;m not sure how this issue has been there so long.  I checked back and it&amp;apos;s been doing the following since I originally wrote it:
executionContext.put(key, rs.getObject("OBJECT_VAL"));
Which will never work, since getObject will just return a Byte[].  Perhaps it&amp;apos;s a reflection of usage that no one has caught this?
