Stopping a job in STARTING state throws OptimisticLockingFailureException
When i try to stop a JobExecution in STARTING state it throws an OptimisticLockingFailureException (Attempt to update job execution id=#### with wrong version (0), where current version is 1) and the job goes in FAILED state. I call the SimpleJobService.stop method on a job in STARTING STATE.
