ResourceLineReader eats newlines within a record&apos;s field
Considering the lines:
1,2,"3
4"
5,6,7
The expected return value of two consecutive calls to the read() method of ResourceLineReader are (without &lt; and &gt;):
call 1:
&lt;1,2,"3
4"&gt;
call 2:
&lt;5,6,7&gt;
But currently, call 1 returns 
&lt;1,2,"34"
&gt;
(notice that the newline is misplaced...)
