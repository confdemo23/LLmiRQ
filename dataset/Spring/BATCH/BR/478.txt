Incorrect message logged in SimpleJobLauncher when TaskExecutor is set
Regardless of whether a (custom) TaskExecutor is specified, SimpleJobLauncher always logs the following message in afterPropertiesSet(): "No TaskExecutor has been set, defaulting to synchronous executor". See attached patch for a fix. Note that this patch requires that afterPropertiesSet() is called or else a NPE will be thrown.
