Serialization bug in JobExecution
Serialization bug in JobExecution.  When deserialized, the transient field stepExecutions is assumed to be not null in createStepExecution().  I think it maybe comes from an old version where StepExecution had a reference to a Step - and was therefore not really Serializable.
