StepExecution attributes can overflow and cause spurious OptimisticLockingException
StepExecution attributes can overflow in the attrs table and in the step execution table (the "compressed" version).  I hacked the DDL to extend the columns, but we have to catch the exceptions and deal with them better - the job cannot be re-run if the meta-data are corrupt (it should get status UNKNOWN).
