Batch support schemas does not include RI and primary keys 
It looks like BATCH_JOB_PARAMS and BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION_ATTRS do not include primary keys. (It also appears that these two tables are not yet used anywhere). Also, the schema does include referential integrity between tables. 
It becomes difficult to get an approval from DBA&amp;apos;s to approve such table structure...
Of course, RI can be manually added as an easy workaround, but still...
