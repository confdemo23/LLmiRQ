problem when using refcursor in StoredProcedureItemReader
When using the StoredProcedureItemReader, as I understand it, in order to use a refcursor, the "refCursorPosition" property must be set to a value greater than zero  pointing to the position of the declared parameter that is intended to be a ref cursor.  However, when I set the said property to 3 (i had 2 IN parameters and 1 OUT parameter), an exception is thrown saying:
"refCursorPosition specified as 3 but there are only 3 parameters defined"
Same exception is thrown if I specify "2" and move my out parameter as the 2nd parameter  this time saying:
"refCursorPosition specified as 2 but there are only 3 parameters defined"
Looking at the code, it looks like the culprit is this assert statement in the openCursor method:
	Assert.state(refCursorPosition == 0 || refCursorPosition &gt; parameters.length, 
			"refCursorPosition specified as " + refCursorPosition + " but there are only " + 
			parameters.length + " parameters defined.");
The 2nd condition should have been:  refCursorPosition &lt;= parameters.length
