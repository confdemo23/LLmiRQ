MongoItemReader needs property to set collection
The MongoItemReader needs the ability to set the collection explicitly. This can&amp;apos;t be done through the query and from the look of the current code it is relying on the type to determine the collection. This will only work if the mongo data contains the "_class column - ie the data was created through spring originally. 
In our case we need to read all records as raw JSON and process that. The data does not contain the "_class (and this would not work anyway as we want to read as string). 
We want to set query="{ }" and targetType="java.lang.String" 
To get this to work I have had to create a copy of the MongoItemReader, add a collection property and modify the line






return (Iterator&lt;T&gt;) template.find(mongoQuery, type).iterator(); 






to 






return (Iterator&lt;T&gt;) template.find(mongoQuery, type, collection).iterator();






This then allows us to set the desired collection on the bean and then everything works correctly.
