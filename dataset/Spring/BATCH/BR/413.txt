Unhandled IndexOutOfBounds in DrivingQueryItemReader
In the getCurrentKey() method of org.springframework.batch.io.driving.DrivingQueryItemReader, if currentIndex is 0, you will get an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. This occurred when my KeyGenerator query returned 0 results for a particular batch job.
Is this supposed to be handled gracefully or is it an error?  Is it a condition that my query must return at least 1 result?
