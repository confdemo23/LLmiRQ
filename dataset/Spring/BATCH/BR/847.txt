FaultTolerantChunkOrientedTasklet loses chunks when non-skippable exceptions thrown in read phase
FaultTolerantChunkOrientedTasklet loses chunks when non-skippable exceptions are thrown during the read phase.  This is true for exceptions thrown in Readers or in ItemListeners.  The RepeatTemplate doesn&amp;apos;t see this as a fatal exception so it keeps going.  The chunk that was processed is lost and the reader picks up at the next record or page from where the failure occurred.
If there is an error in the SQL statement used for a JdbcPagingItemReader then the end result looks like there was nothing to process.
Having the read throw a fatal exception for any non-skippable exception would solve this specific issue.  Not sure of that would cause some other side effects.
