ItemSkipPolicyItemHandler does not count items
In 1.0.1 release, the resolution of  "http://jira.springframework.org/browse/BATCH-531" issue causes another issue.
The item count has move to SimpleItemHandler. The write method calls contribution.incrementItemCount().
The problem is in ItemSkipPolicyItemHandler, subclass of SimpleItemHandler. This class doesn&amp;apos;t call incrementItemCount.
In my application, using 1.0.0 release item count ends with one number more than total items, and in 1.0.1, ends always with 0 (zero).
