StepScope responsibilities can be assumed by Step (not ApplicationContext)
StepScope responsibilities can be assumed by Step (not ApplicationContext).  The aim (to clarify issues raised below), is to make scope="step" strongly advised but not mandatory for item readers and writers in simple steps.  Application programmers are very welcome to use scope="step" where they need access to the context through StepContextAware, since this is consistent with other custom scope usages.  They are also advised to use scope="step" wherever there is a possibility of more than one thread executing the same step - as in the case of a JMX launcher (see samples) or a web service that runs jobs.  Step scope is not necessary for single JVM, single Job processes, but it would be recommended to use it anyway, in case the job is ever run in a mult-threaded container.
