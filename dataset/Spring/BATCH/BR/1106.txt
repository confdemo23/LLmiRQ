SqlPagingQueryProviderFactoryBean ascending should default to true
Kind of a minor issue, though it did cause me a lot of grief.  On switching to RC1 and updating my previous SimpleDelegatingPagingQueryProvider beans to use the new SqlPagingQueryProviderFactoryBean, I got was no longer getting anything past the first page of results because it was suddenly ordering &amp;apos;DESC&amp;apos; instead of &amp;apos;ASC&amp;apos;.  Even though the ascending property defaults to true in the actual query providers, the factory bean is explicitly setting the property every time and it defaults to false there.
