Retry does not work if additional exception occurs in the ItemWriter during scan for failure
I expect the configuration &lt;chunk commit-interval="5" retry-limit="5" skip-limit="5"&gt; to be applied for both processor and writer. This does not seem to work as expected with the writer, where retry is non at all, if the writer runs in "recoverer".
The attachment contains a maven-project that demonstrates the issue:
1. springbatch.test.components.batch.retry_in_writer.RetryInWriterTest
2. springbatch.test.components.batch.retry_in_processor.RetryInProcessorTest
The first test will do all work in the writer and the batch fails because a functional error causes the writer to be run in recoverer. The first item will be skipped. The second item will get a deadlock on the first try, this is not handled with a retry and causes the batch to fail.
The second test does the work in the processor (which seems like the right thing to do, but that is not the point. The first item will be skipped. The second item will get the deadlock, retried and the processor will continue to process the rest of the chunk.
It seems that the errorhandling works as expected in the processor, but not in the writer. Our solution is to use the processor and just do flush in the writer, but it would be nice to have the same errorhandling in the writer or an explanation on why not.
