OraclePagingQueryProvider has inconsistent names for columns in jumpToItemQuery
OraclePagingQueryProvider has inconsistent namesfor columns in jumpToItemQuery.  It only matters if you use the column names (e.g. queryForLong() which is more common wouldn&amp;apos;t be affected), but all the other query providers have "SORT_KEY" as a column name alias, whereas the Oracle version doesn&amp;apos;t use an alias.
