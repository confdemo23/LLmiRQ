MinMaxPartitioner sets incorrect max value
The max value in MinMaxPartitioner is incorrect set, as min is effectively being multiplied twice by range:
			 int min = (i++)*range;
			 int max = Math.min(total, (min+1)*range);
The max line should presumably be:
			int max = Math.min(total, i * range);
(I am assuming that this is what the partitioner is supposed to be doing)
