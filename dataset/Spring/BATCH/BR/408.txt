Parallel job sample is prone to OptimisticLockingException
Parallel job sample is prone to OptimisticLockingException when using commons DBCP and Oracle (and probably other RDBMS, but not HSQL or Derby).  The "toy" databases that we currently test with do not really support multi-threaded access.  When you upgrade there are issues with optimistic locking exceptions.  The exceptions are meaningful - they tell you that the step execution in the database is not accurately reflecting the current status of the job.
