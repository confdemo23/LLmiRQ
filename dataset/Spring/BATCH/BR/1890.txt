Fix broken JDK5 build after Spring 3.1.2
After the 3.1.2 upgrade, the build broke as it was building with JDK5 and I was using JDK6 (and didn&amp;apos;t notice stax issue). I&amp;apos;ve enabled the tiger profile in infrastructure and made a reflection fix in StaxUtils. getXMLEventReader/getXMLEventWriter are package private and getMethod returns public.
