Revert retry-limit and skip-limit changes from BATCH-1396.
The changes in BATCH-1396 for retry-limit and skip-limit caused too many problems with step inheritance (parent="..." in a step).  This task is to track the release of a new version that reverts those changes.  You can still do late binding of those values by injecting a retry-policy or skip-policy, and that might be as far as we ever go.
