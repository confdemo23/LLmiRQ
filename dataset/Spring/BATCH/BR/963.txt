ExecutionContext modifications in ItemStream.close(ExecutionContext) are not persisted
There is an issue with semantics - the close(..) method is typically used to release resources after step completion but can also be used to store values in execution context. In the first case  failure in close(..) shouldn&amp;apos;t cause step failure, in the latter it should.
The easy way to go would be to document the behavior, or maybe we can simply remove the ExecutionContext method argument?
