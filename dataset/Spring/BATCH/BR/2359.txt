CommandLineJobRunner - Content defined after an empty line is ignored when pipe mechanism is used
The job arguments are stored in a file that looks like the following code snippet.






sample job parameter file






#




foo=bar









foo2=bar2






When I call CommandLineJobRunner after a pipe, it ignores the second job argument (foo2=bar2).






cat jobParameterFile | java -classpath foo.jar org.springframework.batch.core.launch.support.CommandLineJobRunner jobs/jobName.xml jobName
