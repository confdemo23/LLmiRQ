JobRepository default is inconsistent between job and step
The way that the job repository property is defaulted in job and step is inconsistent.  With Step, it&amp;apos;s done the right way, by defaulting in the namespace, with good documentation.  However, job is done in the parser:
		String repositoryAttribute = element.getAttribute("repository");
		if (!StringUtils.hasText(repositoryAttribute)) 
{
			repositoryAttribute = "jobRepository";
		}
		builder.addPropertyReference("jobRepository", repositoryAttribute);
There are many others like this in job.
