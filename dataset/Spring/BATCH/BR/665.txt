ChunkListeners are registered on stepOperations in RepeatOperationsStepFactoryBean - should be chunkOperations
In RepeatOperationsStepFactoryBean.applyConfiguration(), the chunk listeners are registered on the stepOperations, which means they are executed when the step starts and when it ends, which seems to be wrong : as name and javadoc mentions it, ChunkListeners are executed around a chunk, i.e. inside the transaction boundaries.
The other step factory bean SimpleStepFactoryBean correctly registers the chunk listeners on the chunkOperations.
