ItemReaders and ItemWriters using Resource(s) should check for file during ItemStream#open
During bean initialization MultiResourceItemReader checks [in afterPropertiesSet()] that it actually has resources to read. If not, it throws an exception. There are use cases where the resources might not be created at bean initialization time (see http://forum.springframework.org/showthread.php?t=57502 for details).
Lucas Ward suggests that this check might better be made during ItemStream#open().
