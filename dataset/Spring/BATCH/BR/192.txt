ScheduledJobIdentifier.scheduleDate can cause issues because it is java.util.Date
ScheduledJobIdentifier.scheduleDate is a java.util.Date, rather than a java.sql.Date.  This makes sense from a domain perspective, since tying our domains objects to java.sql.* wouldn&amp;apos;t be good.  However, older versions of DB2 may have issues converting from from util.Date to sql.Date.  So far I have only seen this in the sql daos, but I still need to do more testing with Hibernate.  I was able to create a work around by creating a custom factory that would create the schedule date as a java.sql.Date, since it extends util.Date, however, it might be worth while to just translate to sql.Date in the sql daos, to avoid any issues.
If it is decided that we should stay completely in java.util.Date, and out of java.sql.*, then Timestamps would also need to be modfied in the *Execution classes as well, and would definitely require some translation in sql, and some testing with Hibernate to see how it would handle the conversion.
