The "initialized" field in org.springframework.batch.test.DataSourceInitializer shouldn&apos;t be static.
The initialized field in org.springframework.batch.test.DataSourceInitializer is declared as:
private static boolean initialized = false;
This shouldn&amp;apos;t be static as this causes issues when the DataSourceInitializer class is used more than once for initializing more than one DataSources.
