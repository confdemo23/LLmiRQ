Merge user attributes in StepContext with ExecutionContext
Developers find StepContext easy to locate and use, and mistakenly assume that its attributes ight be persisted (like the ExecutionContext).  It&amp;apos;s an easy mistake to make, so maybe user defined attributes in StepContext should use an ExecutionContext, or maybe a separate API in StepContext could provide the same feature.
