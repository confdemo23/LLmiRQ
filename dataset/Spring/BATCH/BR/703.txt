JdbcJobInstanceDao doesn&apos;t locate JOB_INSTANCE on Oracle where JOB_KEY is empty
Oracle has this "feature" where an empty string is stored as NULL.  This causes the JdbcJobInstanceDao to fail to look up existing JOB_INSTANCE where the key is empty since the JOB_KEY is stored as NULL in the database and must be queried using JOB_KEY IS NULL.  The end result is that there will be a new JOB_INSTANCE created even though a matching one already exists.
The JdbcJobRepositoryTests expose this issue.
