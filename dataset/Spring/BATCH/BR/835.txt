sql error "column ambiguously defined" in JdbcJobInstanceDao
I&amp;apos;m getting BadSqlGrammarException "column ambiguously defined" on oracle while executing query in JdbcJobInstanceDao.getJobInstance(). The problem is in following query: 
SELECT JOB_INSTANCE_ID, JOB_NAME, JOB_KEY, VERSION from %PREFIX%JOB_INSTANCE ji, %PREFIX%JOB_EXECUTION je where JOB_EXECUTION_ID = ? and ji.JOB_INSTANCE_ID = je.JOB_INSTANCE_ID
Poor oracle doesn&amp;apos;t know from which table to get JOB_INSTANCE_ID and VERSION.
Simple addition of "ji." to these two columns works fine.
