FlatFileItemWriter logs as JdbcBatchItemWriter
Updating your log configuration (log4j.properties) to see logs specifically from org.springframework.batch.item.file.FlatFileItemWriter does not work because that class incorrectly identifies itself as org.springframework.batch.item.database.JdbcBatchItemWriter.
A patch is attached, which has been verified with a full maven build against the trunk.
