BatchCommandLineLauncher simplified and rename
BatchCommandLineLauncher simplified and renamed.  There are simply too many ways to skin this cat, and we don&amp;apos;t want to try and cover everyone&amp;apos;s preferences in one main method.  Rename as SimpleCommandLineJobDispatcher (or something?), and make it work in the simple case that there is one application context (in XML) and a named Job (possibly one of many), with two optional runtime parameters (a key and a schedule date).  The JobLauncher is identified by type.
