Calling update before read on DrivingQueryItemReader causes ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsError
When calling the update method on the DrivingQueryItemReader to save the state to the execution context, an attempt is made to get the current key by doing a get(currentIndex - 1) on the keys list.  Unfortunately, since the read() method has not yet been called, the currentIndex is still at 0, and an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsError is thrown.
