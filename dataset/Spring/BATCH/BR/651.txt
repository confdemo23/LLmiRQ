buffered readers don&apos;t handle volatile commit interval
If commit interval is decreased after rollback buffered readers simply clear the item buffer on mark() - this happens when used e.g. with batchUpdateWriter which causes commits on each item after rollback.
All buffered readers should be consolidated not to duplicate the item buffering logic (common superclass is probably the way to go until BATCH-592 can be implemented).
