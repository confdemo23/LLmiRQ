RecordSeparatorPolicy#isEndOfRecord wrong javadoc?
I have an issue using FlatFileItemReader with a custom RecordSeparatorPolicy. The javadoc of RecordSeparatorPolicy#isEndOfRecord  tells 

Signal the end of a record based on the content of a line, being the latest line read from an input source. The input is what you would expect from BufferedReader.readLine() - i.e. no line separator character at the end. But it might have line separators embedded in it.
I would think the parameter is last read line from file. If I see the code of 
FlatFileItemReader#applyRecordSeparatorPolicy






 




while (line != null &amp;&amp; !recordSeparatorPolicy.isEndOfRecord(record)) {






Actually this is not a line, this is whole record. It makes FlatFileItemReader unusable for my purposes.
