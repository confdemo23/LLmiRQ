File writers do not behave correctly on rollback
File writers do not behave correctly on rollback.  It doesn&amp;apos;t seem to affect regular users of FlatFileItemWriter (and XML) but if you write one item at a time instead of all at once in a transaction which rolls back, then no data are ever written by the writer.
The bug is in TransactionAwareBufferedWriter which fails to clear its transaction resource on rollback.
