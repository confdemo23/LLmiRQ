allow-start-if-complete and start-limit should be on <step/>, not <tasklet/>
It is currently not possible to set allow-start-if-complete or start-limit on a TaskletStep using the namespace because the attributes are on &lt;tasklet/&gt; instead of step.  We should be able to do the following:
    &lt;step id="step1" tasklet="myTasklet" allow-start-if-complete="true" start-limit="100" /&gt;
