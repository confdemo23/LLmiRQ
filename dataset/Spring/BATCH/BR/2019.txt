Support PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer delegation to job contexts
Spring Batch uses children of AbstractApplicationContextFactory to create child application contexts for each batch job. By default, it will pass PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer and CustomEditorConfigurer bean post processors to the child contexts as configured in the default constructor of AbstractApplicationContextFactory. However, it does not pass PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer bean post processors by default. Therefore, using the Spring 3.1 Environment functionality in conjunction with &lt;context:properties-placeholder/&gt; does not work out of the box. You must manually add that class to the list of bean post processors. It would be great if this default behavior could be changed to support the Spring 3.1 convention.
