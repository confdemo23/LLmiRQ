StagingItemReader is not restartable
StagingItemReader is not restartable because it updates the process indicator in the read() method, which is only ever called once per item (used to be once per item per transaction in 1.x).  I&amp;apos;m not sure the best way to fix this.  The reader knows the id of the record to be updated, but that information is lost further downstream in the processing pipeline.  Maybe it&amp;apos;s time to get serious about ChunkContext or @ChunkAttribute (see BATCH-920)?
It would be a good time to replace the innards of StagingItemReader anyway - it can delegate most of its stateful behaviour to an off the shelf JDBC ItemReader.
