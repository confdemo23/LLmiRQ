FlatFileItemReader doesn&apos;t take "firstLineIsHeader" flag into account when restarting
FlatFileItemReader doesn&amp;apos;t take "firstLineIsHeader" flag into account when restarting so the restart begins with the last successfully processed item rather than the one following it.  This is only an issue if the flat file contains a header line.
