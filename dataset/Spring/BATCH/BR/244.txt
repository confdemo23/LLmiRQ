Repeated processing of items does not work if exception is in first chunk
If an exception occurs during the processing of a chunk an ExceptionHandler in the StepOperations can be used to signal the framework to rollback the current chunk. It is assumed that the default behaviour of the DefaultStepExecutor used in all the examples has the ability to process all items again that could be handled successfully in the previous execution of the chunk. The item which caused the processing of the chunk to fail should be skipped. Unfortunately this does not work out of the box. An attached example which is based on tradeJob.xml should show this.
