Make "VERSION" meaningful?
The version field in Entity and the corresponding VERSION field in the database schema doesn&amp;apos;t seem to have any meaning right now. Where are these values supposed to come from? I can&amp;apos;t seem to track it down in the code. 
It would make sense for job instance to have the version number of the job config as defined by the user, and likewise for step / step config
I can&amp;apos;t imagine what version would mean for the execution metadata... if it has the same meaning then it&amp;apos;s redundant.
Or am I misunderstanding what the version field is supposed to mean?
