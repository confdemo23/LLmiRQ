aop / template interceptor class names ambiguous
RepeatInterceptor vs. RepeatOperationsInterceptor
RetryInterceptor vs. RetryOperationsInterceptor
Each of these pairs is badly named. Perhaps the aop ones might be renamed "Advisor" so as not to be as confusing?
i.e.
RepeatOperationsAdvisor
RetryOperationsAdvisor
