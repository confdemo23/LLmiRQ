StepExecutionResourceProxy&apos;s toString() leads to NPE
Since it is possible to call toString before the delegate is set, toString will throw a NPE.
For example, when setResource() is invoked on FlatFileItemReader
public void setResource(Resource resource) throws IOException {
		this.resource = resource;
		path = resource.toString();
		if (path.length() &gt; 50) 
{
			path = path.substring(0, 20) + "..." + path.substring(path.length());
		}
	}
you end up with a NPE when you try to get the path.
