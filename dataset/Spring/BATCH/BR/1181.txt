<step/> element always assumes the step is a TaskletStep
The namespace&amp;apos;s &lt;step/&gt; element always assumes it is creating a TaskletStep so it tries to set properties such as transactionManager and jobRepository.  However, the &lt;step/&gt; should be flexible enough to handle any implementation of Step so that if a user defines their own Step they can use it with the namespace to construct a FlowJob.
In order to resolve this issue, properties need to be removed from the &lt;step/&gt; element and moved to an inner element.  The new &lt;step/&gt; structure will be as follows:
&lt;step&gt;
    &lt;tasklet&gt;
        &lt;chunk-tasklet/&gt;
    &lt;/tasklet&gt;
&lt;/step&gt;
Where:
The &lt;chunk-tasklet/&gt; is the new name of what used to be &lt;tasklet/&gt;.  It is used to create a Chunk-Oriented TaskletStep.
The new &lt;tasklet/&gt; contains the properties that used to be on &lt;step/&gt;.  It is used to create a TaskletStep and it has a ref= that can reference a Tasklet implementation.
The &lt;step/&gt; contains only id=, parent=, abstract=, and flow transitions.  It can be used with any Step implementation.
